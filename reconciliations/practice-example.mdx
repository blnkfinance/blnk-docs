import NeedHelp from "/snippets/need-help.mdx";

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to perform a simple one-to-one reconciliation workflow with Blnk. This includes:

1. Preparing and uploading our data.
2. Creating our matching rules.
3. Running our reconciliation process.
4. Review the reconciliation results.

For this example, we'll use Postman or cURL to send our API requests. You can also refer to the [API reference](/reference/start-reconciliation) for details on the available endpoints.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. A running Blnk server instance (e.g. at `http://localhost:5001`). Version 0.10.0 or later.

---

## Recording sample transactions

First, import the following sample transactions using the [Bulk Transactions](/transactions/bulk-transactions) feature:

```
POST https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions/bulk
```
```json Request body [expandable]
{
  "atomic": true,

}
```

## Preparing the external data

Next, download the sample CSV file provided below.

This file will act as our external data source and has already been formatted to meet Blnk's specifications. See [External Data Preparation](/reconciliations/external-data) for more details.

  Click to download sample CSV file.
</Card>

---

## Uploading the data

Upload your CSV file with the [Upload Data](/reference/upload-data) endpoint:

```
POST https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/reconciliation/upload
```

or use cURL

```bash
curl --location 'https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/reconciliation/upload' \
--form 'file=@recon-example-external-source.csv' \
--form 'source=Stripe'
```

```json Response
{
  "record_count": 10,
  "source": "Stripe",
  "upload_id": "upload_0cd4a87d-544c-4b7e-9232-f36e79631c32"
}
```

<Tip>Save the `upload_id`. You’ll need it to start the reconciliation.</Tip>

---

## Setting our matching rules

We’ll define rules to match internal and external transactions. For this example, we want:

1. **Amount Match**: Exact amount match

2. **Currency Match**: Exact matches for both fields.

3. **Reference Match**: Partial match (external reference contains the internal reference).

All rules must be true for successful matching. Create the rule with this request:

```
POST http://localhost:5001/reconciliation/matching-rules
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "name": "Basic matcher",
    "description": "Matches transactions by amount and reference",
    "criteria": [
        {
            "field": "amount",
            "operator": "equals"
        },
        {
            "field": "currency",
            "operator": "equals"
        },
        {
            "field": "reference",
            "operator": "contains"
        }
    ]
}
```
```json Response
{
    "rule_id": "rule_3d5ae6d4-6722-40c5-ac4b-0bd66ab7d363",
    "created_at": "2025-03-17T08:31:24.97610651Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-03-17T08:31:24.976106635Z",
    "name": "Basic matcher",
    "description": "Matches transactions by amount and reference",
    "criteria": [
        {
            "field": "amount",
            "operator": "equals",
            "value": "",
            "pattern": "",
            "allowable_drift": 0
        },
        {
            "field": "currency",
            "operator": "equals",
            "value": "",
            "pattern": "",
            "allowable_drift": 0
        },
        {
            "field": "reference",
            "operator": "contains",
            "value": "",
            "pattern": "",
            "allowable_drift": 0
        }
    ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Save the `rule_id` for the reconciliation step.</Tip>

---

## Run reconciliation

With the external data uploaded and our matching rules configured, we’re ready to run our first reconciliation. 

In this example, we’ll use the [Batch Reconciliation](/reconciliations/overview#option-1-batch-reconciliation) option and apply a `one_to_one` strategy to ensure precise matching.

See [Reconciliation Strategies](/reconciliations/strategies) for details.

Send this request to start the reconciliation:

```
POST https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/reconciliation/start
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "upload_id": "upload_0cd4a87d-544c-4b7e-9232-f36e79631c32",
    "strategy": "one_to_one",
    "matching_rule_ids": [
        "rule_3d5ae6d4-6722-40c5-ac4b-0bd66ab7d363"
    ]
}
```
```json Response
{
    "reconciliation_id": "recon_f1df3e68-fd8d-4566-8670-891c3c1e7d58"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## View reconciliation results

Finally, you can view the status of your reconciliation with the following endpoint:

```
GET https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/reconciliation/{reconciliation_id}
```

```json Response
{
  "reconciliation_id": "recon_f1df3e68-fd8d-4566-8670-891c3c1e7d58",
  "upload_id": "upload_0cd4a87d-544c-4b7e-9232-f36e79631c32",
  "status": "completed",
  "matched_transactions": 2,
  "unmatched_transactions": 8,
  "is_dry_run": false,
  "started_at": "2025-03-17T08:32:24.005476Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-03-17T08:32:24.062136Z"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `matched_transactions` | Number of external records matched. |
| `unmatched_transactions` | Number of external records not matched. |

## Error handling

1. **401 Unauthorized**: Ensure your API key is correct and included in the `Authorization` header.

2. **400 Bad Request**: Check your request body or file format. For uploads, ensure the CSV matches Blnk’s specifications.

3. **404 Not Found**: Verify the endpoint URL (e.g., `/reconciliation/upload` for uploads, `/reconciliation/start` for reconciliation).
