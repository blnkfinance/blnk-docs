## Data preparation

Blnk requires your external data in a certain format to perform reconciliation with your ledger. We require the following fields in your uploaded data:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `amount` | Float | The transaction amount, e.g. 100.50 |
| `currency` | String | ISO 4217 currency code, e.g. "USD" |
| `source` | String | Origin of the transaction data, e.g. "Stripe" |
| `description` | String | Transaction details or narration, e.g., "Monthly subscription" |
| `reference` | String | Unique identifier of the transaction, e.g., "ref_128GA6Ag1298ahkj" |
| `date` | ISO 8601 | Transaction date and time, e.g., "2023-04-15T14:30:00Z" |


## Things to note

Take note of the following when uploading external data to prevent errors or mismatches in your reconciliation:

- Use consistent formatting across all fields. 
- Ensure that each transaction has a unique `reference` value.
- Convert your `date` value to the UTC timezone to avoid timezone discrepancies.
