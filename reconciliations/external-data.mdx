## Overview

External data refers to files and datasets containing transaction activity records from sources outside your Ledger, such as bank statements or payment processor reports.

Since these data are exported in various formats, it’s essential to standardize them before uploading to Blnk Core for reconciliation to ensure accuracy and compatibility

---

## Preparing your data

After exporting your data from the external source, convert it into the specified structure below, ensuring each record includes the following attributes:

| Attributes | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `id` | String | Unique external transaction id. |
| `amount` | Number | The transaction amount, e.g. 100.50 |
| `currency` | String | ISO 4217 currency code, e.g. "USD" |
| `source` | String | Origin of the transaction data, e.g. "Stripe" |
| `description` | String | Description/narration of the transaction, e.g. "Monthly subscription" |
| `reference` | String | Unique transaction reference, e.g., "ref_128GA6Ag1298ahkj" |
| `date` | String | Transaction date and time, e.g., "2025-02-15T13:30:00Z" |

Once set, export your data in CSV or JSON and upload for reconciliation.

### Key considerations

1. Use consistent formatting across all fields.
2. Ensure that each transaction has a unique `reference`.
3. Convert your `date` to the UTC timezone to avoid timezone discrepancies.

## Upload your data

Upload your formatted data to Blnk with the following endpoint:

```bash Request
curl --location 'https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/reconciliation/upload' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
--form 'file=@transactions.json' \
--form 'source=Stripe'
```
```json Response
{
  "upload_id": "upload_8c700d1b-09c0-4ef4-9ab1-a0decf3d0aa3",
  "status": "success",
  "record_count": 1000,
  "source": "Stripe"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `upload_id` | Unique identifier of the uploaded external record for reconciliation. |
| `status` | Indicates that the file was uploaded successfully. |
| `record_count` | Counts the number of records found in the uploaded file. |
| `source` | Indicates the source of the file. |
