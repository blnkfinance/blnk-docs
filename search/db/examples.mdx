  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "filters": [
      { "field": "status", "operator": "eq", "value": "APPLIED" },
      { "field": "amount", "operator": "gte", "value": 10000 }
    ],
    "sort_by": "amount",
    "sort_order": "desc",
    "limit": 50
  }'
```

```json Response wrap
