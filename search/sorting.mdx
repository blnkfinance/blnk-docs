The `sort_by` parameter controls the order of your search results. You can sort by any field in ascending or descending order, and combine up to three fields for multi-level sorting.

## Quick start

Here's how to sort transactions by creation date in descending order (newest first):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "*",
    "sort_by": "created_at:desc"
  }'
```

## Sort syntax

### Basic sorting

Sort by a single field using the format `field:direction`:

```bash
# Sort by amount (lowest to highest)
"sort_by": "amount:asc"

# Sort by creation date (newest to oldest)
"sort_by": "created_at:desc"
```

### Sort directions

| Direction | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `asc` | Ascending order (A-Z, 0-9, oldest to newest) | `amount:asc` |
| `desc` | Descending order (Z-A, 9-0, newest to oldest) | `created_at:desc` |

### Multi-field sorting

Combine up to three fields separated by commas. Fields are applied in order: the first field is primary, second breaks ties, third breaks remaining ties:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "*",
    "sort_by": "status:asc,created_at:desc,amount:desc"
  }'
```

This sorts by:
1. **Status** (ascending) - groups by status first
2. **Created date** (descending) - within each status, newest first  
3. **Amount** (descending) - for same status and date, highest amount first

## Common sorting patterns

<Steps>
<Step title="Sort by creation date">
Show the most recent records first, useful for transaction monitoring.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "*",
    "sort_by": "created_at:desc"
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Sort by amount">
Find the largest transactions first for financial analysis.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "*",
    "sort_by": "amount:desc"
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Sort balances by amount">
Identify accounts with the highest balances.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/balances" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "*",
    "sort_by": "balance:desc"
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Multi-level transaction sorting">
Group by status, then show newest transactions first within each status.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "*",
    "sort_by": "status:asc,created_at:desc"
  }'
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- **Default to newest first**: Use `created_at:desc` for time-sensitive data like transactions.
- **Combine with filtering**: Sort filtered results for more targeted analysis.
- **Limit multi-field sorting**: Use 2-3 fields maximum to avoid complexity.
