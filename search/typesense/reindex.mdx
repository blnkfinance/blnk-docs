Reindexing is typically needed after deploying a fresh Typesense instance, migrating to a new Typesense cluster, or recovering from Typesense data loss while your primary database remains intact.

In this scenario, Typesense is empty while your primary database holds transactions, balances, ledgers, and identities. Reindexing populates Typesense with all existing records so search works correctly.

## How it works

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Trigger the reindex">
Blnk reads all records from your database and indexes them into their respective Typesense collections (transactions, balances, ledgers, identities).

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/search/reindex"
```
```json Response
{
    "status": "in_progress",
    "phase": "indexing_transactions",
    "total_records": 2145709,
    "processed_records": 2145709,
    "started_at": "2026-02-12T12:13:10.448612096Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor progress">
Check the reindex status. Completion time depends on the size of your data.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/search/reindex" 
```
```json Response
{
    "status": "completed",
    "phase": "done",
    "total_records": 3240705,
    "processed_records": 3240705,
    "started_at": "2026-02-12T12:13:10.448612096Z",
    "completed_at": "2026-02-12T12:18:42.018420264Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify completeness">
Once the reindex finishes, confirm that all records are in Typesense by searching each collection with `q: "*"` to return all records. 

```bash wrap
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/search/{collection} \
-H 'X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
-d '{ "q": "*" }'
```

Compare `found` and `out_of` values with your expected record counts. If anything is missing, run the reindex again.
</Step>
