While using the Blnk Ledger, you might encounter negative balances. A negative balance simply indicates that the ledger has more debits than credits.

This indicator allows you to quickly assess the financial position of a ledger balance at a glance while reviewing your data.

<Info>
  `balance` = `credit_balance` - `debit_balance`
</Info>

| Balance ID | balance | debit_balance | credit_balance |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: |
| bal_abc123 | -20000 | 45000 | 65000 |
| bal_def456 | 10000 | 20000 | 30000 |

In the table above, the balance for `bal_abc123` is -20000, indicating that debits exceed credits, resulting in a negative balance. On the other hand, `bal_def456` has a positive balance of 10000 because credits exceed debits.

## How to avoid negative balances

Negative balances are not a cause for alarm.

However, if you prefer to avoid negative balances in your ledger, here’s how you can adjust your setup.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Designate a funding pool balance in your General Ledger.">
    Use a designated funding pool balance to pre-fund your ledger balances with starting balances. This approach ensures you can post transactions on those balances without triggering overdrafts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply overdrafts when funding from the funding pool balance.">
    This ensures that only the funding pool balance incurs a negative balance, while your customer balances and other critical balances remain unaffected.

    ```json {5,8}
    {
      "amount": 120000.23,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "ref_123abc",
      "source": "@FundingPool",
      "destination": "bal_customer",
      "description": "Creating a starting balance",
      "apply_overdraft": true
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      Always ensure this implementation aligns with your [money movement map](/ledgers/money-movement-map). Depending on the flow of funds within your system, not all balances may need to be pre-funded. 
      
      This decision should be guided by the specific requirements of your financial system.
