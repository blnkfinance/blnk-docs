## 1. Managing side effects with Refund

When dealing with financial transactions, it's crucial to handle scenarios where things don't go as planned. One common situation is when a payment verification from a provider is not successful after funds have been moved. 

In such cases, we need to reverse the transaction using Blnk's refund endpoint.

First, let's perform the initial transfer:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript NodeJS
const request = require('request');

const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  url: 'http://localhost:5001/transactions',
  headers: {
    'X-Blnk-Key': 'blnk-api',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "amount": 150.00,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref-0-07",
    "description": "Payment to ExternalProvider",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_e39a239a-a6ca-4509-b0d9-29dcc5630f8a",
    "destination": "@external-provider",
    "meta_data": {
      "provider_reference": "ext-pay-123456",
      "customer_id": "1234"
    }
  })
};

request(options, (error, response) => {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```
```json Response
{
    "precise_amount": 15000,
    "amount": 150.00,
    "rate": 0,
    "precision": 100,
    "transaction_id": "txn_7f8a9b1c-2d3e-4f5g-6h7i-8j9k0l1m2n3o",
    "parent_transaction": "",
    "source": "bln_e39a239a-a6ca-4509-b0d9-29dcc5630f8a",
    "destination": "@external-provider",
    "reference": "ref-0-07",
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "Payment to ExternalProvider",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "hash": "3p4q5r6s7t8u9v0w1x2y3z4a5b6c7d8e9f0g1h2i3j4k5l6m7n8o9p0q",
    "allow_overdraft": false,
    "inflight": false,
    "created_at": "2024-07-05T09:15:30.123456789Z",

    "inflight_expiry_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "meta_data": {
        "provider_reference": "ext-pay-123456",
        "customer_id": "1234"
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Handling Webhooks and Automating Refunds

In a real-world scenario, you would typically set up a webhook to receive notifications from your payment provider about the status of transactions. Let's set up a simple Express.js server to handle the webhook and automate the refund process:

```javascript NodeJS
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const request = require('request');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Webhook endpoint
app.post('/payment-webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { status, providerReference, amount, currency } = req.body;

  console.log(`Received webhook: Status ${status} for payment ${providerReference}`);

  if (status === 'FAILED') {
    console.log(`Payment ${providerReference} failed. Initiating refund process.`);
    initiateRefund(providerReference, amount, currency);
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});

// Function to find the original transaction ID based on provider reference
function findTransactionId(providerReference) {
  // In a real-world scenario, you would query your blnk here
  // For this example, we'll return a mock transaction ID
  return "txn_7f8a9b1c-2d3e-4f5g-6h7i-8j9k0l1m2n3o";
}

// Function to initiate the refund
function initiateRefund(providerReference, amount, currency) {
  const transactionId = findTransactionId(providerReference);

  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'http://localhost:5001/refund-transaction/{transactionID}',
    headers: {
      'X-Blnk-Key': 'blnk-api',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  };

  request(options, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error processing refund:', error);
    } else {
      console.log('Refund processed successfully:', response.body);
      // Here you might want to update your internal database, notify the customer, etc.
    }
  });
}

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

Now, let's break down this example:

1. We set up an Express.js server with a `/payment-webhook` endpoint to receive notifications from the payment provider.
2. When a webhook is received, we check the status of the payment. If it's 'FAILED', we initiate the refund process.
3. The `findTransactionId` function is a placeholder for where you would typically query your database to find the original Blnk transaction ID based on the provider's reference. In a real-world scenario, you would store this mapping when initiating the original transaction.
4. The `initiateRefund` function calls the Blnk refund endpoint, similar to our previous example.

To test this setup, you can use a tool like cURL to simulate a webhook from your payment provider:

```shell cURL
curl -X POST <http://localhost:3000/payment-webhook> \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"status": "FAILED", "providerReference": "ext-pay-123456", "amount": 150.00, "currency": "USD"}'
```

This cURL command simulates a failed payment notification from your provider.

```shell 
Received webhook: Status FAILED for payment ext-pay-123456
Payment ext-pay-123456 failed. Initiating refund process.
Refund processed successfully: {"refund_id":"rfd_1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l3m4n5o6p","transaction_id":"txn_7f8a9b1c-2d3e-4f5g-6h7i-8j9k0l1m2n3o","status":"APPLIED","amount":150.00,"currency":"USD","reason":"Payment verification failed","created_at":"2024-07-05T10:30:15.123456789Z","meta_data":{"failed_verification_code":"VERIF-001","provider_reference":"ext-pay-123456"}}
```

### Best practices for managing side effects and webhook handling

1. **Immediate Action**: Process refunds as soon as you receive notification of a failed verification to ensure good customer experience.
2. **Detailed Logging**: Always include detailed information in the `meta_data` field. This aids in troubleshooting and auditing.
3. **Balance Verification**: Always verify the balance after processing a refund to ensure the transaction was successful.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your refund process. If a refund fails, you may need to retry or escalate to manual intervention.
5. **Customer Communication**: Implement a system to notify customers about the failed transaction and subsequent refund.
6. **Reconciliation**: Regularly reconcile your internal records with Blnk's transaction and refund logs to ensure accuracy.
7. **Verify Webhook Authenticity**: In a production environment, implement a mechanism to verify that the webhook is genuinely from your payment provider. This often involves checking a signature or secret key.
8. **Idempotency**: Ensure your webhook handler is idempotent. Providers may send the same webhook multiple times, so your system should handle duplicate notifications gracefully.
9. **Asynchronous Processing**: For high-volume systems, consider processing webhooks asynchronously. You can acknowledge receipt immediately and process the webhook contents in a background job.
10. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for your webhook endpoint. This can help you quickly identify and respond to any issues in the payment verification and refund process.

When you run this command, you should see output in your server logs similar to:

## 2. Managing side effects with Inflight

### Example: Using Inflight for a payment requiring additional information

Let's consider a scenario where we need to transfer $750.00 from Customer A's USD wallet to an external payment provider, but the payment requires additional verification before being finalized. We'll use the Inflight feature to manage this process.

First, let's initiate the transaction with the Inflight flag:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript NodeJS
const axios = require('axios');

async function createInflightTransaction() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5001/transactions', {
      amount: 750.00,
      precision: 100,
      reference: "ref_001adcfgf",
      description: "Payment to ExternalProvider (Pending Verification)",
      currency: "USD",
      source: "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
      destination: "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
      inflight: true,
      inflight_expiry_date: "2024-02-03T12:38:19Z",
      meta_data: {
        provider_reference: "ext-pay-123456",
        customer_id: "1234",
        verification_status: "PENDING"
      }
    }, {
      headers: {
        'X-Blnk-Key': 'your-blnk-api-key-here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    console.log('Inflight transaction created:', response.data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating inflight transaction:', error.response.data);
    throw error;
  }
}

createInflightTransaction();
```
```json Expected response
{
    "transaction_id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",

### Handling webhooks and automating inflight transaction resolution

Let's set up a simple Express.js server to handle webhooks and automate the Inflight transaction resolution process:

```javascript NodeJS
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const axios = require('axios');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Webhook endpoint
app.post('/payment-webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { status, providerReference, amount, currency } = req.body;

  console.log(`Received webhook: Status ${status} for payment ${providerReference}`);

  try {
    if (status === 'VERIFIED') {
      console.log(`Payment ${providerReference} verified. Committing transaction.`);
      await commitInflightTransaction(providerReference);
    } else if (status === 'REJECTED') {
      console.log(`Payment ${providerReference} rejected. Voiding inflight transaction.`);
      await voidInflightTransaction(providerReference);
    }
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing webhook:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error processing webhook');
  }
});

async function findTransactionId(providerReference) {
  // In a real-world scenario, you would query your database here
  // This is a placeholder implementation
  return "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d";
}

async function commitInflightTransaction(providerReference) {
  const transactionId = await findTransactionId(providerReference);

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(`http://localhost:5001/transactions/${transactionId}/inflight`, {
      status: "commit",
      meta_data: {
        verification_status: "VERIFIED",
        provider_reference: providerReference
      }
    }, {
      headers: {
        'X-Blnk-Key': 'your-blnk-api-key-here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    console.log('Transaction committed successfully:', response.data);
    // Here you might want to update your internal database, notify the customer, etc.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error committing transaction:', error.response.data);
    throw error;
  }
}

async function voidInflightTransaction(providerReference) {
  const transactionId = await findTransactionId(providerReference);

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(`http://localhost:5001/transactions/${transactionId}/inflight`, {
      status: "void",
      meta_data: {
        verification_status: "REJECTED",
        provider_reference: providerReference
      }
    }, {
      headers: {
        'X-Blnk-Key': 'your-blnk-api-key-here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    console.log('Transaction voided successfully:', response.data);
    // Here you might want to update your internal database, notify the customer, etc.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error voiding transaction:', error.response.data);
    throw error;
  }
}

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

This example demonstrates:

1. Setting up a webhook endpoint to receive notifications from your payment provider.
2. Processing the webhook based on the payment status (VERIFIED or REJECTED).
3. Committing or voiding the Inflight transaction accordingly.
4. Error handling and logging.

### Using expiry dates with inflight transactions

Expiration dates are crucial for managing Inflight transactions effectively. They ensure that transactions don't remain in a pending state indefinitely, which could potentially lock funds unnecessarily.

### Example: Setting and handling expiration

```javascript NodeJS
const axios = require('axios');

async function createInflightTransactionWithExpiry() {
  const expiryDate = new Date();
  expiryDate.setHours(expiryDate.getHours() + 24); // Set expiry to 24 hours from now

  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5001/transactions', {
      amount: 750.00,
      precision: 100,
      reference: "ref_001adcfgf",
      description: "Payment to ExternalProvider (Pending Verification)",
      currency: "USD",
      source: "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
      destination: "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
      inflight: true,
      inflight_expiry_date: expiryDate.toISOString(),
      meta_data: {
        provider_reference: "ext-pay-123456",
        customer_id: "1234",
        verification_status: "PENDING"
      }
    }, {
      headers: {
        'X-Blnk-Key': 'your-blnk-api-key-here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    console.log('Inflight transaction created with expiry:', response.data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating inflight transaction:', error.response.data);
    throw error;
  }
}

createInflightTransactionWithExpiry();
```

<Note>
    Blnk automatically voids the transaction once the expiration date is met and the transaction has not been committed fully.
</Note>

### Implementing partial commits for inflight transactions

Partial commits allow you to finalize a portion of an Inflight transaction while keeping the remainder in the Inflight state. This is particularly useful for scenarios where a transaction may be processed in parts.

### Example: Partial commit of an inflight transaction

```javascript NodeJS
async function partialCommitInflightTransaction(transactionId, amountToCommit) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(`http://localhost:5001/transactions/${transactionId}/inflight`, {
      status: "commit",
      amount: amountToCommit
    }, {
      headers: {
        'X-Blnk-Key': 'your-blnk-api-key-here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    console.log('Partial commit successful:', response.data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in partial commit:', error.response.data);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage example
async function handlePartialPaymentVerification(transactionId, verifiedAmount) {
  try {
    await partialCommitInflightTransaction(transactionId, verifiedAmount);
    console.log(`Partially committed ${verifiedAmount} for transaction ${transactionId}`);

    // You might want to update your internal records here
    await updateInternalRecords(transactionId, verifiedAmount);

    // Check if there's any remaining amount to be verified
    const remainingAmount = await checkRemainingInflightAmount(transactionId);
    if (remainingAmount > 0) {
      console.log(`Remaining inflight amount for ${transactionId}: ${remainingAmount}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Transaction ${transactionId} fully committed`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling partial payment verification:', error);
  }
}

async function updateInternalRecords(transactionId, committedAmount) {
  // Implement your logic to update internal records
  console.log(`Updating internal records for ${transactionId} with committed amount ${committedAmount}`);
}

async function checkRemainingInflightAmount(transactionId) {
  // This would typically involve querying Blnk's API or your database
  // For demonstration, we'll return a mock value
  return 250.00; // Assuming 500 out of 750 was committed
}

// Example usage
handlePartialPaymentVerification('txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d', 500.00);
```

In this example:

1. We defined a `partialCommitInflightTransaction` function that commits only a portion of the Inflight transaction.
2. The `handlePartialPaymentVerification` function demonstrates how you might use partial commits in your payment flow:
    - It commits the verified amount.
    - Updates internal records.
    - Checks if there's any remaining amount still in the Inflight state.
3. The `checkRemainingInflightAmount` function (which you would implement to query Blnk's API or your database) helps track the progress of partial commits.

By using partial commits, you can handle complex scenarios where funds are released incrementally, such as:

- Multi-stage payment processes.
- Partial fulfillment of orders.
- Gradual release of funds based on milestone completions in a project.

### Best practices for managing side effects with Inflight

1. **Balance Checks**: Ensure the source balance has enough funds to complete the transaction. Prevent the source balance from having a balance lower than the amount in its inflight_debit_balance.
2. **Available Balance Calculation**: This prevents users from accessing funds that are held in Inflight transactions. In your application, calculate the available balance as:
    ```jsx
    const availableBalance = balance - inflight_debit_balance;
    ```
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your Inflight process. If a commit or void operation fails, you may need to retry or escalate to manual intervention.
4. **Customer Communication**: Implement a system to notify customers about the status of their transactions, especially when they're held in Inflight.
5. **Reconciliation**: Regularly reconcile your internal records with Blnk's transaction logs to ensure accuracy, paying special attention to Inflight transactions.(Blnk v1 will support reconcillation features built into the ledger).
6. **Webhook Authentication**: In a production environment, implement a mechanism to verify that the webhook is genuinely from your payment provider.
7. **Idempotency**: Ensure your webhook handler is idempotent. Providers may send the same webhook multiple times, so your system should handle duplicate notifications gracefully.
8. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for your webhook endpoint and Inflight transactions. This can help you quickly identify and respond to any issues in the payment verification process.
