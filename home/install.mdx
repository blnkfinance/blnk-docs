## What is Blnk?

Blnk offers an open-source financial ledger database for building and scaling fintech products. With Blnk, you can:

- Accurately record transactions in your system.
- Correctly [manage complex flow of funds](../ledgers/money-movement-map) and transaction data.
- Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.

## 1. Install Blnk on your machine

To install Blnk, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and running on your machine.

To get started with Blnk, first clone the repository into your machine:

```bash bash
git clone https://github.com/blnkfinance/blnk && cd blnk
```

Next, create a configuration file, `blnk.json`:

```bash bash
touch blnk.json
```

Then copy and save the following configuration:

```json blnk.json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis:6379"
  },
  "server": {
    "domain": "blnk.io",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_email": "jerryenebeli@gmail.com",
    "port": "5001"
  },
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Launch Blnk

Start your Blnk server with Docker compose:

```bash bash
docker compose up
```

If successful, you should be able to access your server on the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

## 3. Create your first ledger

Everything in Blnk begins with a ledger. Ledgers are used to group and manage how you arrange your [ledger balances](#5-create-your-first-balance) in our application.

When you install Blnk, an internal ledger called [the General Ledger](../ledgers/general-ledger) is created for you. This is a ledger meant for grouping all of the balances directly owned by your organization, e.g., Revenue, Fees, etc.

However, to create, store and represent balances for accounts/wallets owned by the users in your application, it is required to create ledgers to group them in.

To create a ledger, call the **create-ledger** endpoint:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/ledgers
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "name": "Customer Savings Account",
    "meta_data": {
        "project_owner": "YOUR_APP_NAME"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI
blnk ledgers create
? Ledger Name: <ledger-name>
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```
</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "name": "Customer Savings Account",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC",
    "meta_data":{
        "project_owner": "YOUR_APP_NAME"
    }
}
```

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Request">
        | Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `name` | A name that best describes the function of the ledger | Yes | `string`
		| `meta_data` | Custom data associated with the ledger being created | No | `object`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Response">
        | Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | --- 
		| `ledger_id` | Unique identification number for your ledger | `string`
		| `name` | The name of your ledger | `string`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of when it was created | `string`
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, you can view a list of all your ledgers:

```bash Blnk CLI
blnk ledgers list
```

## 4. Create your first balance

Ledger balances (or balances for short) are used to represent store of value in a fintech application, e.g., [wallet](../use-cases/multicurrency), [account](../use-cases/savings), [card balance](../use-cases/virtual-cards), etc. They represent the source or destination of a transaction record.

To create a balance, call the **create-balance** endpoint:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "currency": "USD",
    "meta_data": {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Hart",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI
blnk balances create
? Ledger ID: <ledger-id>
? Currency: <currency>
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```
</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "balance": 0,
    "version": 0,
    "inflight_balance": 0,
    "credit_balance": 0,
    "inflight_credit_balance": 0,
    "debit_balance": 0,
    "inflight_debit_balance": 0,
    "precision": 0,
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "identity_id": "",
    "indicator": "",
    "currency": "USD",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:33:01.311600208Z",
    "meta_data": {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Hart",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
    }
}
```

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Request">
        | Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `ledger_id` | The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to. | Yes | `string`
		| `currency` | The currency in which transactions recorded in this balance will be recorded. | Yes | `string`
		| `meta_data` | Custom data associated with the balance being created | No | `object`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Response">
        | Field | Description | Type

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, to view a list of all your balances:

  ```bash bash
  blnk balances list
  ```


## 5. Record your first transaction

Transactions represent all financial activities happening in your application. Blnk uses the [double entry principle](../guides/double-entry) to record transactions, i.e., to successfully record a transaction, there must be a source and a destination.

To record a transaction, call the **record-transaction** endpoint: 

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "amount": 750,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "USD",
    "precision": 100,
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "description": "Sent from app",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI
blnk transactions create

<Tip>
  Passing detailed data with the `meta_data` object is encouraged; it provides you with 360-degree insights about each transaction record. Examples of data you can pass include `sender_name`, `account_number`, `bank_name`, `receiver_name`, `payment_id`, `ip_address`, `location`, `payment_method`, etc.

### Transaction properties

1. **Immutability:** All transactions in Blnk are immutable. Once they have been recorded, they cannot be altered or tampered with. This ensures the accuracy and unchangeability of the transaction record. See also: [Transaction hashing](../advanced/transaction-hashing)

2. **Idempotency:** All transactions in Blnk are idempotent. This ensures that performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as doing it once. This property is crucial for maintaining consistent outcomes regardless of how many times a transaction is repeated, especially in scenarios where network errors or other issues might cause transaction failures.
  
  <Info>
    Blnk ensures idempotency through the use of a unique `reference` for every transaction. This is why it is required for you to provide one when recording a transaction.  
  </Info>

### Notifications

Notifications are sent via webhook events to let you know the updated status of a transaction:

1. **`transaction.applied`:** This event is sent when a transaction has been processed and applied to the participating balances. It signifies the completion of a transaction's lifecycle.

2. **`transaction.inflight`:** This event is sent when a transaction's status has been updated to `INFLIGHT` and is waiting for a certain condition to be met, as defined by your application. See also: [Inflight transactions](../transactions/inflight)

3. **`transaction.rejected`:** This event is sent when a transaction is rejected because all of the conditions required to process it wasn't met.

## 6. Run your first reconciliation

Reconciliation is a vital component of financial operations, essential for maintaining precise and reliable financial records. 

This process involves comparing and matching internal records (your ledger) with external statements (such as payment processor reports and bank statements) to identify and rectify any discrepancies. The primary goal of reconciliation is to ensure that all records accurately represent the company’s financial position at all times.

To get started:

1. [Upload external data](../reconciliations/overview#1-upload-external-data): Import external data from payment processor reports and bank statements, and prepare them for reconciliation.
2. [Set matching rules](../reconciliations/overview#2-set-matching-rules): Define how transactions should be compared and matched.
3. [Define reconciliation strategies](../reconciliations/overview#3-define-reconciliation-strategies): Choose what type of reconciliation strategy you want to apply.
4. [Run reconciliation](../reconciliations/overview#4-run-reconciliation): Initiate a reconciliation.
