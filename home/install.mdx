## Overview

This is your guide to getting started with Blnk, pronounced as `/blank/`. If you are new to Blnk or [open-source fintech developer tools](https://blnkfinance.com), this is where you should start.

## What is Blnk?

Blnk offers an open-source financial ledger database for building and scaling fintech products. With Blnk, you can:

- Accurately record transactions in your system.
- Correctly [manage complex flow of funds](/ledgers/money-movement-map) and transaction data.
- Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.

---

## 1. Launch Blnk

To install Blnk, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and running on your machine.

To get started with Blnk, first clone the repository into your machine:

```bash bash
git clone https://github.com/blnkfinance/blnk && cd blnk
```

Next, create a configuration file, `blnk.json`:

```bash bash
touch blnk.json
```

Then copy and save the following configuration:

```json blnk.json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis:6379"
  },
  "server": {
    "port": "5001"
  },
  "queue": {
    "monitoring_port": "5004"
  }
}
```

Finally, start your Blnk server with Docker compose:

```bash bash
docker compose up
```

<Check>
Your Blnk server is now running! You can verify it's working by visiting `http://localhost:5001` in your browser.
</Check>

## 2. Create your first transaction

Now that Blnk is running, let's create your first transaction. Blnk uses the [double entry principle](/guides/double-entry) to record transactions, which means every transaction must have a source and destination.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5001/transactions' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "amount": 1000,
    "reference": "first_transaction_001",
    "currency": "USD",
    "precision": 100,
    "source": "@FundingPool",
    "destination": "@MyBalance",
    "description": "My first Blnk transaction",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "meta_data": {}
  }'
```
```json Response
{
  "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
  "source": "@FundingPool",
  "destination": "@MyBalance",
  "reference": "first_transaction_001",
  "amount": 1000,
  "precision": 100,
  "precise_amount": 100000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "description": "My first Blnk transaction",
  "allow_overdraft": true,
  "status": "QUEUED",
  "created_at": "2024-12-21T01:36:46.997063436Z",
  "meta_data": {}
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
Congratulations! You've successfully created your first transaction in Blnk.
</Check>

Finally, let's view our balances to confirm that the transaction was recorded:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5001/balances'
```
```json Response
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "balance": -1000,
      "version": 1,
      "inflight_balance": 0,
      "credit_balance": 0,
      "inflight_credit_balance": 0,
      "debit_balance": 1000,
      "inflight_debit_balance": 0,
      "queued_credit_balance": 0,
      "queued_debit_balance": 0,
      "precision": 100,
      "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
      "identity_id": "",
      "balance_id": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
      "indicator": "@FundingPool",
      "currency": "USD",
      "created_at": "2024-12-21T01:36:46.997063436Z",
      "meta_data": null
    },
    {
      "balance": 1000,
      "version": 1,
      "inflight_balance": 0,
      "credit_balance": 1000,
      "inflight_credit_balance": 0,
      "debit_balance": 0,
      "inflight_debit_balance": 0,
      "queued_credit_balance": 0,
      "queued_debit_balance": 0,
      "precision": 100,
      "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
      "identity_id": "",
      "balance_id": "bln_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
      "indicator": "@MyBalance",
      "currency": "USD",
      "created_at": "2024-12-21T01:36:46.997063436Z",
      "meta_data": null
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This will return a list of all balances in your system. You should see the `@FundingPool` balance (which will be negative since it funded the transaction) and the `@MyBalance` balance (which will show the amount we transferred).

<Check>
You've successfully completed the Blnk getting started guide! You now have a working Blnk instance with your first transaction recorded.
