## What is Blnk?

Blnk offers an open-source financial ledger database for building and scaling fintech products. With Blnk, you can:

- Accurately record transactions in your system.
- Correctly [manage complex flow of funds](/ledgers/money-movement-map) and transaction data.
- Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.

---

## 1. Install Blnk on your machine

To install Blnk, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and running on your machine.

To get started with Blnk, first clone the repository into your machine:

```bash bash
git clone https://github.com/blnkfinance/blnk && cd blnk
```

Next, create a configuration file, `blnk.json`:

```bash bash
touch blnk.json
```

Then copy and save the following configuration:

<Warning>Remember to change your password before deploying to production.</Warning>

```json blnk.json
{
  "project_name": "Blnk",
  "data_source": {
    "dns": "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/blnk?sslmode=disable"
  },
  "redis": {
    "dns": "redis:6379"
  },
  "server": {
    "port": "5001"
  }
}
```

## 2. Launch Blnk

Start your Blnk server with Docker compose:

```bash bash
docker compose up
```

If successful, you should be able to access your server on the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

---

## 3. Create your first ledger

Everything in Blnk begins with a ledger. Ledgers are used to group and manage how you arrange your [ledger balances](#5-create-your-first-balance) in our application.

When you install Blnk, an internal ledger called [the General Ledger](/ledgers/general-ledger) is created for you. This is a ledger meant for grouping all of the balances directly owned by your organization, e.g., Revenue, Fees, etc.

However, to create, store and represent balances for accounts/wallets owned by the users in your application, it is required to create ledgers to group them in.

To create a ledger, call the **create-ledger** endpoint:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/ledgers
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "name": "Customer Savings Account",
    "meta_data": {
        "project_owner": "YOUR_APP_NAME"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI
blnk ledgers create
? Ledger Name: <ledger-name>
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```
</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "name": "Customer Savings Account",
    "created_at": "2024-12-21T01:36:46.997063436Z",
    "meta_data":{
        "project_owner": "YOUR_APP_NAME"
    }
}
```

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Request">
        | Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `name` | A name that best describes the function of the ledger | Yes | `string`
		| `meta_data` | Custom data associated with the ledger being created | No | `object`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Response">
        | Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | --- 
		| `ledger_id` | Unique identification number for your ledger | `string`
		| `name` | The name of your ledger | `string`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of when it was created | `string`
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, you can view a list of all your ledgers:

```bash Blnk CLI
blnk ledgers list
```

## 4. Create your first balance

Ledger balances (or balances for short) are used to represent store of value in a fintech application, e.g., wallet, [crypto](/resources/examples/order-exchange), [account](/resources/examples/savings), [card balance](/resources/examples/virtual-cards), etc. They represent the source or destination of a transaction record.

To create a balance, call the **create-balance** endpoint:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "currency": "USD",
    "meta_data": {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Hart",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI
blnk balances create
? Ledger ID: <ledger-id>
? Currency: <currency>
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```
</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "balance": 0,
    "version": 0,
    "inflight_balance": 0,
    "credit_balance": 0,
    "inflight_credit_balance": 0,
    "debit_balance": 0,
    "inflight_debit_balance": 0,
    "precision": 0,
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "identity_id": "",
    "indicator": "",
    "currency": "USD",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:33:01.311600208Z",
    "meta_data": {
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Hart",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
    }
}
```

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Request">
        | Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `ledger_id` | The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to. | Yes | `string`
		| `currency` | The currency in which transactions recorded in this balance will be recorded. | Yes | `string`
		| `meta_data` | Custom data associated with the balance being created | No | `object`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Response">
        | Field | Description | Type

		| `debit_balance` | Sum of all debit transaction amounts in the balance. | `int64`
    | `credit_balance` | Sum of all credit transaction amounts in the balance. | `int64`
		| `balance` | `credit_balance` - `debit_balance`. | `int64`
		| `inflight_debit_balance` | Total amount awaiting to be deducted from your balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_credit_balance` | Total amount awaiting to be added to your balance. | `int64`
		| `inflight_balance` | `inflight_credit_balance` - `inflight_debit_balance`. | `int64`

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, to view a list of all your balances:

  ```bash bash
  blnk balances list

## 5. Record your first transaction

Transactions represent all financial activities happening in your application. Blnk uses the [double entry principle](/resources/double-entry) to record transactions, i.e., to successfully record a transaction, there must be a source and a destination.

In the code example below, we'll fund our balance created above with a starting amount.

To record a transaction, call the **record-transaction** endpoint: 

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request {3,9}
{
    "amount": 750,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "USD",
    "precision": 100,
    "source": "@FundingPool",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "description": "Fund with starting balance amount",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI {3,9}
blnk transactions create
? Amount: <amount>
? Precision: <precision>
? Reference: <reference>
? Description: <description>
? Currency: <currency>
? Source: <source>
? Destination: <destination>
? Allow overdraft: (y)
? Inflight: (n)
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
If this is your first transaction, the participating balances will start at 0. To ensure the transaction is successful, enable overdrafts as shown above, allowing the source balance to go negative.

Learn more about [Overdrafts](/transactions/overdrafts) and [Negative Balances](/resources/negative-balances).
</Tip>

```json Response {3}
{
    "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "@FundingPool",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "amount": 750,
    "precision": 100,
    "precise_amount": 75000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "Fund with starting balance amount",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "created_at": "2024-12-21T01:36:46.997063436Z",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Passing detailed data with the `meta_data` object is encouraged; it provides you with 360-degree insights about each transaction record. Examples of data you can pass include `sender_name`, `account_number`, `bank_name`, `receiver_name`, `payment_id`, `ip_address`, `location`, `payment_method`, etc.
</Tip>

Next, you can view a list of all transactions in your ledger:

```bash bash
blnk transactions list
```
