Blnk supports scheduling a transaction for a later specified date. This can be useful for both one-time or recurring transactions that need to automatically happen at a certain date in the future.

## 1. Scheduling a transaction

To schedule a transaction, include the `scheduled_for` field in your request body when calling the **record-transaction** endpoint.

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Request {8}
{
    "amount": 100000,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "@fees",
    "scheduled_for": "2024-12-21T01:36:46+01:00",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

<Tip>
    Always format the `scheduled_for` date input as 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00' (e.g., 2024-04-22T15:28:03+00:00), where `+00:00` specifies the timezone. It is UTC by default.

```json Response {12}
{
    "id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
    "source": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "destination": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "reference": "ref",
    "amount": 100000,
    "precision": 100,
    "precise_amount": 10000000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "created_at": "2024-12-21T01:36:46.997063436Z",
    "scheduled_for": "2024-12-21T01:36:46+01:00",
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```

Blnk accepts and adds the transaction to its queue. Once the scheduled time is reached, the transaction gets applied and you receive a notification via the `transaction.applied` webhook event.

### Canceling a scheduled transactions
  
To cancel a scheduled transaction on your ledger, schedule a new transaction for a few seconds after the original scheduled transaction. 

The destination balance of the original transaction becomes the source, and the original source becomes the destination. This way, the transaction is canceled on your ledger.
