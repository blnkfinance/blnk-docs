Sometimes, you need to refund a transaction. Blnk allows you to process a refund using the `transaction_id` of the original transaction.

Refunds only happen on transactions that have been applied. This means that the participating balances have been updated with the transaction amount from the original transaction.

When you refund a transaction, Blnk creates a new transaction record and switches the `source` and `destination` balances of the original transaction — debiting the amount from the balance that initially received it and crediting it to the balance that initially sent it.

## Applying refunds

Use the **refund-transaction** endpoint and pass the transaction_id of the transaction that you want to refund.

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/refund-transaction/{transaction_id}
```

## Refunding transactions with multiple sources/destinations.

Multiple sources in Blnk allow you send from multiple sources to a single destination simultaneously, while multiple destinations allow you to send from one source to multiple destinations.

Learn more: [Multiple Sources](multiple-sources) and [Multiple Destinations](multiple-destinations).

<Warning>
    When you use multiple sources, the transactions are recorded separately in the ledger. However, they are grouped with a parent transaction id. This is the id shown in the response of your initial request.
</Warning>

To bulk refund transactions initiated with multiple sources/destinations, call the **refund transaction endpoint**, and pass the parent transaction id. 

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/refund-transaction/{transaction_id}
```

This automatically refunds all of the transactions from their respective destinations to their source.
