Blnk also supports recording transactions between ledger balances of different asset classes using the `rate` field. 

<Warning>
    **Important:** Avoid applying rates to transactions within the same currency, as it is unnecessary and redundant.
</Warning>

**Let's dive in ✨**

What we'll cover …

1. [Applying rates](#1-applying-rates)
2. [Key considerations](#2-key-considerations)

## 1. Applying rates

Consider a transaction record sending USD 2,290.19 from a USD balance to a GBP balance. 

The first thing is to calculate the exchange rate value against the `source`, i.e., by how much should you multiply the transaction amount to convert from the source's currency to the destination's currency.

In our example, 1 USD = 0.79 GBP. This means `"rate": 0.79`.

```json Request {6-8}
{
  "reference": "ref_1234567890",
  "amount": 2290.19,
  "currency": "USD",
  "precision": 100,
  "rate": 0.79,
  "source": "bal_usd",
  "destination": "bal_gbp"
}
```

<Warning>
  Failing to specify a `rate` value for transactions between currencies can result in incorrect destination balances and ledger discrepancies. Always include an exchange rate to ensure accuracy.
</Warning>

### What happens next

1. Blnk applies the rate to the transaction amount: 2290.19 * 0.79 = 1803.09
2. Blnk applies the precision to the converted amount: 1803.09 * 100 = 180309
3. Blnk records the amount as `180309` in `bal_gbp`, and `229019` in `bal_usd` and computes their balances.

## 2. Key considerations

1. Only send money between balances whose different asset classes have the same `precision` value, i.e., USD to GBP work well because the precision value for their lowest unit possible is 100. However, NGN to BTC is not advisable.

2. Always specify your `precision` value in your transaction payload to ensure consistency in how your balance is computed.
