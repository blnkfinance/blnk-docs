## Overview

An inflight transaction keeps your transaction on hold until you take further action. When enabled using the `inflight` parameter, transactions follow a specialized workflow that maintains separate balances for pending operations.

It is best used when you want to wait for feedback or authorization before a transaction is applied in your ledger.

## Before we start,

Remember that all ledger balances in Blnk have 6 main balance parameters:

1. `balance`: This shows the current value held in the ledger balance.
2. `credit_balance`: This is the total sum of all amounts received by a ledger balance.
3. `debit_balance`: This is the total sum of all amounts sent by a ledger balance.
4. `inflight_balance`: This shows the net amount held inflight for a balance.
5. `inflight_credit_balance`: This is the total sum of all amount waiting to be received by a ledger balance.
6. `inflight_debit_balance`: This is the total sum of all amount waiting to be deducted from a ledger balance.

## How Inflight works

### 1. Record transaction with Inflight
```json Record inflight {9}
{
    "amount": 100,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "description": "For vacation",
    "inflight": true
}
```

When recording a new transaction with Inflight, the system, by default, will:

1. Initializes the transaction in the `QUEUED` state.
2. Processes and moves the transaction to `INFLIGHT`.
3. Maintains the original balances while tracking the pending amounts in inflight balance parameters.

### 2. Balance management
![Step 1: How a transaction is processed in Inflight](/images/step-01-02-using-inflight.png)

Blnk uses three balance parameters for accurate tracking of inflight amounts:

```
inflight_credit_balance: Pending credits awaiting processing
inflight_debit_balance:  Pending debits awaiting processing
inflight_balance:        Net inflight amount (credit - debit)
```

### 3. Balance tracking example

Consider an inflight transaction where $100 is transferred from balance_A to balance_B:

```
Initial State:
balance_A: $200 available funds
balance_B: $0 available funds

Transaction Amount: $100
``` 

| `balance_id` | **Main balance** | **Inflight balance** | **Inflight credit** | **Inflight debit** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `balance_A` | 200 | -100 | 0 | 100 |
| `balance_B` | 0 | 100 | 100 | 0 |

In this scenario:

* `balance_A` shows a negative inflight balance (-100) because funds are pending outflow.
* `balance_B` shows a positive inflight balance (100) because funds are pending inflow.
* The main balances remain unchanged until the transaction is committed.

### 4. Updating Inflight
![Scenarios when inflight transactions are finished processing](/images/step-03-using-inflight.png)

To act on an inflight transaction, use the [Update Inflight](/reference/update-inflight) endpoint: 

```
PUT /transactions/inflight/{transaction_id}
```

There are two ways to act on an inflight transaction: commit or void.

#### i. Commit inflight

```json Request
{
    "status": "commit"
}
```

* Indicates transaction conditions are met.
* Triggers balance updates, and clears the inflight balances.
* Creates new transaction record with `APPLIED` status.

In our example, after commit:

| `balance_id` | **Main balance** | **Inflight balance** | **Inflight credit** | **Inflight debit** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `balance_A` | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `balance_B` | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

#### ii. Partial commits

```json Request
{
    "status": "commit",
    "amount": 40
}
```

* Only the specified amount is applied to the main balances.
* The remaining amount is left inflight.

<Note>Partial commit amount must not exceed remaining inflight amount.</Note>

Our example after a partial commit:

| `balance_id` | **Main balance** | **Inflight balance** | **Inflight credit** | **Inflight debit** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `balance_A` | 160 | -60 | 0 | 60 |
| `balance_B` | 40 | 60 | 60 | 0 |

#### iii. Void inflight

```json Request
{
    "status": "void"
}
```

* Indicates transaction conditions were not met.
* Creates new transaction record with `VOID` status.
* Resets inflight balances without affecting actual balances.

#### iv. Expired inflight

A transaction will stay inflight indefinitely unless it gets committed, void, or gets expired. To set a time limit on an inflight transaction, include the `inflight_expiry_date` parameter in the request body.

* Indicates transaction remained `INFLIGHT` past specified expiry date.
* Creates new record with a `VOID` status.
* Discards the transaction and resets the inflight balances.

```json Record inflight with expiry date {10}
{
    "amount": 100,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "description": "For vacation",
    "inflight": true,
    "inflight_expiry_date": "2024-12-21T01:36:46+01:00"
}
```

<Tip>
    Always format the `inflight_expiry_date` date input as 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00' (e.g., 2024-04-22T15:28:03+00:00), where `+00:00` specifies the timezone. It is UTC by default.
</Tip>

## Verifying inflight statuses

To verify an inflight transaction after commit or void:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Update Inflight response">
When you use the [Update Inflight](/reference/update-inflight) endpoint, the API returns a response indicating the final status:

- **`APPLIED`**: Transaction was successfully committed
- **`VOID`**: Transaction was voided or expired
</Step>

<Step title="Verify using Search API (optional)">
You can also verify transaction status using the Search API:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="When skip_queue = false (default)">
Use the **queued transaction ID** to retrieve all its child transactions:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "<queued_transaction_id>",
    "query_by": "meta_data.QUEUED_PARENT_TRANSACTION"
  }'
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="When skip_queue = true">
Use the **inflight transaction ID** to search for all its child transactions:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions" \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "q": "<inflight_transaction_id>",
    "query_by": "parent_transaction"
  }'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Inflight for multiple sources/destinations

Multiple sources in Blnk allow you send from multiple sources to a single destination simultaneously, while multiple destinations allow you to send from one source to multiple destinations.

Learn more: [Multiple Sources](/transactions/multiple-sources) and [Multiple Destinations](/transactions/multiple-destinations).

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Initiate inflight">
        When initiating inflight transactions with multiple sources/destinations, enable the inflight feature in your transaction request. Here's how to structure your request:

        ```json Request
        {
            // ... other transaction details
            "inflight": true
        }
        ```

        When using multiple sources/destinations, each transaction is recorded separately in the ledger. 

        However, these transactions are linked together through a `parent_transaction` attribute, which you'll receive in the response to your transaction request. This `parent_transaction` helps you track and manage related transactions as a single unit.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update Inflight">
        To commit or void all transactions at once, call the [Update Inflight endpoint](/reference/update-inflight) and pass the `transaction_id` from your response.

        ```
        PUT http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions/inflight/{parent_transaction}
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Use cases

Useful applications for `inflight` include:

- **For managing KYC limits:** When an account crosses its KYC limits determined by your application, you can hold all deposits with inflight until the user's KYC is updated.
- **[For escrow](/resources/examples/escrow):** Inflight allows you to easily implement escrow features in your application, allowing your users see the amount being held (but not available to them to spend).
- **For card payouts:** Hold amounts in an inflight balance until the card is authorized by the payment processor for successful payment.  
- **For external payouts:** Hold amount in an inflight balance while your payout is being processed by your provider; only release it when the transaction is successful or failed.
