## Overview

The Bulk Transaction API enables you to process multiple transactions within a single request. It offers two processing options: **atomic processing**, where all transactions either succeed or fail as a unit, and **independent processing**, where each transaction is handled separately. 

Additionally, the API supports asynchronous processing to efficiently manage large batches of transactions.

---

## Creating bulk transactions

To process multiple transactions in a single request, call the [Bulk Transactions](/reference/bulk-transactions) endpoint.

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions/bulk
```

### Request body

```json 
{
  "atomic": true,
  "inflight": false,
  "run_async": false,
  "skip_queue": false,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "amount": 358.90,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "unique_reference_1",
      "description": "Transaction description",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "source": "@source_account",
      "allow_overdraft": true,
      "destination": "@destination_account"
    },
    {
      "amount": 358.90,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "unique_reference_2",
      "description": "Transaction description",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "source": "@source_account",
      "allow_overdraft": true,
      "destination": "@destination_account"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `atomic` | Boolean | Yes | When `true`, either all transactions succeed or all fail. When `false`, transactions are processed independently. |
| `inflight` | Boolean | Yes | When `true`, transactions are created in `INFLIGHT` status and require a separate commit. When `false`, transactions are processed immediately. |
| `run_async` | Boolean | No | When `true`, processing happens in the background and results are delivered via webhook. When `false` or not provided, processing happens synchronously and results are returned in the response. |
| `skip_queue` | Boolean | No | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, transactions bypass the queue system. Learn more: [Why we use queueing](/guides/concurrency#queuing-transactions). |
| `transactions` | Array | Yes | Array of transaction objects. |

### Synchronous response

When `run_async` is false:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "bulk_c62f200b-905f-4983-a349-cadd279234aa",
  "status": "applied | inflight",
  "transaction_count": 4
}
```

### Asynchronous response

When `run_async` is true:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "bulk_c62f200b-905f-4983-a349-cadd279234aa",
  "status": "processing",
  "message": "Bulk transaction processing started"
}
```

### Commit or void bulk inflight

To commit or void all transactions in a batch:

```
PUT http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions/inflight/{batch_id}
```
```json Request body
{
  "status": "commit | void"
}
```

---

## Retrieving transactions in a batch

When you submit a bulk transaction request, Blnk assigns each transaction in the batch its own unique transaction ID but tags them all with the same `parent_transaction` (which is your original `batch_id`). 

To retrieve every transaction in that batch:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/search/transactions
```
<CodeGroup>
```curl cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/search/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-blnk-key: <api-key>" \
  -d '{
    "q": "<batch-id>",
    "query_by": "parent_transaction"
  }'
```
```json JSON Request
{
  "q": "<batch-id>",
  "query_by": "parent_transaction"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

* `q`: The `batch_id` returned when you created the request.
* `query_by`: Must be set to `parent_transaction`.

The response will include an array of all child transactions linked to that `batch_id`.

## Webhook notifications

When using `run_async: true`, the API sends webhook notifications upon completion or failure.

### Webhook structure

The webhooks follow this structure:

```json 
{
  "event": "bulk_transaction.applied",
  "data": {
    "batch_id": "bulk_c62f200b-905f-4983-a349-cadd279234aa",
    "status": "applied",
    "transaction_count": 4,       
    "error": "error message",     
    "timestamp": "2025-03-02T15:30:45+01:00"
  }
}
```

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `event` | String | Name of event. Can be `bulk_transaction.applied`, `bulk_transaction.inflight`, or `bulk_transaction.failed`. |
| `batch_id` | String | Specifies the id of the batch transaction. |
| `status` | String | Status of the batch transaction. Can be `applied`, `inflight`, or `failed`. |
| `transaction_count` | String | Number of transactions in the batch. Only included for successful cases. |
| `error` | String | Error message. Only included for failure cases. |
| `timestamp` | String | Specifies the date & time when the batch transaction was completed. |

## Usage examples

### Synchronous processing

Process multiple transactions atomically (all or nothing):

```json Request
{
  "atomic": true,
  "inflight": false,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "amount": 100.00,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "tx_001",
      "description": "First transaction",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "source": "@account1",
      "destination": "@account2"
    },
    {
      "amount": 50.00,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "tx_002",
      "description": "Second transaction",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "source": "@account2",
      "destination": "@account3"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Asynchronous processing

Process a large batch of transactions in the background:

```json
{
  "atomic": true,
  "inflight": false,
  "run_async": true,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "amount": 100.00,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "tx_001",
      "description": "First transaction",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "source": "@account1",
      "destination": "@account2"
    },
    {
      "amount": 75.00,
      "precision": 100,
      "reference": "tx_999",
      "description": "Last transaction",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "source": "@account5",
      "destination": "@account6"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error handling

### Failed atomic transactions (synchronous)

When using `atomic: true` with `inflight: false` and `run_async: false`, if any transaction in the batch fails, all previously processed transactions will be automatically refunded, and you'll receive an error response like this:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "bulk_4192d961-5b0e-46ca-bf2f-9386763057f8",
  "error": "failed to queue transaction 1 (Reference: ref001, Source: @account1, Destination: @account2, Amount: 50.00): transaction validation failed: reference ref001 has already been used. All transactions in this batch have been refunded."
}
```

### Failed atomic transactions (asynchronous)

When using `atomic: true` with `run_async: true`, if any transaction fails, all transactions will be rolled back, and you'll receive a webhook notification with an error message containing the rollback status:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "bulk_4192d961-5b0e-46ca-bf2f-9386763057f8",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "failed to queue transaction 2 (Reference: ref002, Source: @account1, Destination: @account2, Amount: 75.50): transaction validation failed: insufficient balance. All transactions in this batch have been refunded.",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-02T15:30:45Z"
}
```

### Failed atomic inflight transaction

When using `atomic: true` with `inflight: true`, if any transaction in the batch fails during the inflight creation phase, all previously created inflight transactions will be automatically voided, and you'll receive an error response (or webhook for async) like this:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "bulk_0813d39e-7ead-406b-83de-51eb1975357c",
  "error": "failed to queue transaction 1 (Reference: ref003, Source: @account1, Destination: @account2, Amount: 25.00): transaction validation failed: reference ref003 has already been used. All transactions in this batch have been voided."
}
```

### Failed non-atomic transactions

When using `atomic: false`, if a transaction in the batch fails, only that transaction and the subsequent transactions in the sequence will fail; all previous transactions that succeeded before the failed one will remain applied in your ledger. 

You'll receive an error response (or webhook for async) like this:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "bulk_2adde6a2-87b9-4ef1-ab10-8c5f1a82083c",
  "error": "failed to queue transaction 1 (Reference: ref004, Source: @account1, Destination: @account2, Amount: 125.00): transaction validation failed: reference ref004 has already been used. Previous transactions were not rolled back."
}
```

## Important notes

1. When `atomic` is `true`, transactions are processed in the order provided in the request.
2. Each transaction's `reference` must be unique.
3. When `run_async` is `true`, processing happens in the background and you'll receive an immediate response with a batch ID.
4. For large transaction batches, using `run_async: true` is recommended to avoid timeout issues.
5. Webhook notifications for async processing contain the same detailed error information as synchronous responses, including rollback status.
