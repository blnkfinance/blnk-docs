Every Bink transaction moves through a series of states that reflect its processing status. Understanding these states helps you track your transactions effectively and handle them appropriately in your application.

<Note>Each state change creates a new record in your Blnk Ledger. Learn more about [how transactions work in Blnk](/transactions/introduction#how-transactions-work-in-blnk).</Note>

## Queued Status

When you first create a transaction, it enters a `QUEUED` state. This indicates your transaction has been received and is waiting to be processed by Bink's concurrency-controlled queue system.

## Applied Status

The `APPLIED` state indicates a successful transaction. When you see this state, it means:

* The transaction has been fully processed.
* The source balance has been debited.
* The destination balance has been credited.
* The transaction has completed its lifecycle.

## Inflight Status

When you enable inflight for a transaction in your request, it moves from `QUEUED` to `INFLIGHT`. In this state, the transaction is on hold until you take further action.

From the `INFLIGHT` state, your transaction can move to one of three possible resolution states:

### Applied status

When you send a commit command for an inflight transaction, Bink creates a new record with the APPLIED status, indicating the transaction has been successfully processed and the balances have been updated.

### Void status 

If you send a void command, Bink creates a new record with the `VOID` status, indicating the transaction was not completed and the inflight balances have been reset.

<Tip>For a detailed understanding of how inflight transactions work, including how to manage the transaction lifecycle, please refer to our [inflight documentation](/transactions/inflight).</Tip>

## Rejected Status

The `REJECTED` state occurs only when a transaction's source balance has insufficient funds. When this happens:

* No balance updates occur, preserving the current balance amounts.

Once a transaction reaches the `REJECTED` state, it is final. To retry the transaction, you would need to create a new one. Learn more: [Handling insufficient funds with Blnk](/transactions/introduction#managing-insufficient-funds).

<Warning>
    All transactions in Blnk are immutable. Once a transaction has been applied, committed or voided, you cannot roll back the status to its previous status.
