## Overview

Blnk ensures accuracy by storing transaction amounts and balances as integers, even though real-world values are typically expressed as decimals, such as USD 25.34, BTC 0.248917, or ETH 0.18920753698279.

Precision is a feature that converts these decimals into integers by converting amounts into their smallest asset-specific units:

* Dollar to cent (USD 25.34 becomes 2534 cents)
* Bitcoin to satoshi (BTC 0.248917 becomes 24891700 satoshis)
* Ethereum to wei (ETH 0.189207535698279 becomes 189207535698279000 wei)

Blnk uses the `precise_amount` parameter to store amounts with precision applied in your ledger.

## Determining your precision value

Follow these steps to calculate the best precision value for an asset class:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the smallest possible unit of the asset.">
    For example, the smallest unit for USD is $0.01 (1 cent), and for BTC, it's 0.00000001 (1 satoshi).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert this smallest unit into an integer.">
    To do this, multiply the smallest unit by a factor that results in a whole number. For instance:

    * For USD, multiply 0.01 by 100 to get 1 (since 100 cents makes a dollar).
    * For BTC, multiply 0.00000001 by 100,000,000 to get 1 (since 100 million satoshis makes 1 BTC).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the multiplication factor as your precision value.">
    The number you used to convert the smallest unit to an integer becomes the precision value. In the examples above:

    * USD precision value: 100
    * BTC precision value: 100,000,000

## Applying precision

You can apply precision to amounts in your ledger using one of two options:

1. The `amount` field
2. The `precise_amount` field

### Option 1: Using the `amount` field

To apply precision with the `amount` field, enter the amount as a floating-point value and specify its precision value when recording a transaction.

<Warning>
**Important to note:**

The `amount` field supports up to 15 digits. Exceeding this will throw [a rounding error](/transactions/precision#more-than-15-digits-in-the-amount-field) or truncation; switch to `precise_amount` for accuracy with larger values.
</Warning>

```json Example with "amount" {2,3}
{
  "amount": 750.23,
  "precision": 100,
  "reference": "ref_abc123",
  "currency": "USD",
  "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
  "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
  "description": "Wallet funding"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `amount` | Float | The transaction value as is. |
| `precision` | Number | The precision value (e.g. 100 converts USD to cents) |

The resulting `precise_amount` is stored and used to compute your ledger balances. 

```json Response {6-8}
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_6164573b-6cc8-45a4-ad2e-7b4ba6a60f7d",
  "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
  "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
  "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
  "amount": 750.23,
  "precision": 100,
  "precise_amount": 75023,
  "currency": "USD",
  "description": "For fees",
  "status": "QUEUED",
  "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `precise_amount` | Number | The amount with precision applied. |

### Option 2: Using the `precise_amount` field

<Info>Available in version 0.10.1 or later</Info>

To apply precision with the `precise_amount` field:

* Convert the amount to its smallest unit.
* Enter this value directly into the `precise_amount` field of your request.
* Include the corresponding `precision` value.

```json Example with "precision_amount" {2,3}
{
  "precise_amount": 189207535698279000,
  "precision": 1000000000000000000,
  "reference": "ref_abc123",
  "currency": "ETH",
  "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
  "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
  "description": "Wallet funding"
}
```

The example above correctly logs an ETH amount (18 digits) with full precision down to the smallest unit as shown below: 

```json Response {2-4,6}
{
    "precise_amount": 189207535698279000,
    "amount": 0.189207535698279,
    "amount_string": "0.189207535698279",
    "rate": 1,
    "precision": 1000000000000000000,
    "transaction_id": "txn_d2616e76-5ec6-4621-afe0-c4e3b1d848cb",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "reference": "ref_abc123",
    "currency": "ETH",
    "description": "Wallet funding",
    "status": "QUEUED"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `amount_string` | String | Returns the amount with precision applied without rounding errors or cut offs. |

> **Please note:** <br/> When using `precise_amount` with multiple sources or destinations, use `precise_distribution` instead of `distribution` in your `sources` or `destinations` array. <br/> <br/> This ensures accuracy when specifying fixed amounts with precision applied. 

```json Example with precise_distribution wrap
{
  ...
  "destinations": [
    {
      "identifier": "bln_f2073f6b-905a-4e3e-b5a2-8d1b3dc2fb7f",
      "precise_distribution": "2300000"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "bln_64c50fb5-32d5-4f78-9f4a-e8b01aaf025d",
      "distribution": "left"
    }
  ]
}
```

> See [Multiple sources](/transactions/multiple-sources) and [Multiple destinations](/transactions/multiple-destinations) for more details.

## Important considerations

1. `amount` and `precise_amount` cannot be passed simultaneously when recording a transaction.
2. Ensure that your precision value converts the target amount to the lowest unit possible for its asset class. For example, while 100 works for most fiat currencies, it is not advisable to use it for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 

3. Be consistent with how precision is applied in your application. Transactions with the same `currency` should always have the same precision applied to their amounts.

4. Regularly review and audit your ledger to ensure that precision is applied consistently and correctly.

## Error handling

### More than 15 digits in the `amount` field

When you pass a number with more than 15 digits in the `amount` field:

```json
{
  "errors:": "amount: amount has more than 15 significant digits which may cause rounding errors; use precise_amount instead"
}
```

### Using both precision options together

When you pass both the `amount` and `precise_amount` fields in your request:

```json
{
  "errors": "amount: either amount or precise_amount should be provided, not both."
}
```
