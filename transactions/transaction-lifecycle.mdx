## Overview

Every transaction goes through multiple states in Blnk, and each state change is stored as a separate record in the database. This gives you complete traceability, allowing you to see the lifecycle of a transaction from initiation to completion. 

Each state is connected to the previous state through a `parent_transaction` attribute. Here's how it works:

## Transaction lifecycle

By default, every transaction begins in a `QUEUED` state. 

<Tip>You can track balances with transactions still in queue using [Queued Balances](/balances/introduction#queued-balances).</Tip>

Blnk then processes it and moves it to one of three possible states:

* `INFLIGHT`: If the transaction request includes `"inflight": "true"`. It continues to:
    * `APPLIED`: If the inflight transaction is committed or;
    * `VOID`: If the inflight transaction is voided.
* `APPLIED`: When the transaction is completed and applied to the balances.
* `REJECTED`: When the transaction is not processed due to reasons like insufficient funds, etc.

Here's an example response when you record a new transaction on Blnk:

```json Example response {13}
{
  "precise_amount": 10000000,
  "amount": 100000,
  "rate": 0,

  "inflight_expiry_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Parent transactions

Because transactions in Blnk are immutable, each new state or related record is linked back to the one that created it through the `parent_transaction` field.

<Tip> For example, if you have a \$100 inflight transaction that is later committed, the commit record points to the inflight record as its parent. </Tip>

This structure ensures that every transaction has a clear lineage. By following the `parent_transaction` chain, you can always trace a transaction back to its origin, see how it evolved, and connect it to any related siblings.

- Queued transactions act as the parent of the next state (e.g. `APPLIED`, `INFLIGHT`, `REJECTED`).
- Inflight transactions are the parent of their final outcome (e.g. `APPLIED`, `VOID`).
- Split transactions are the parent of the resulting individual transactions.
- Bulk transactions are the parent of the included individual transactions.
- Scheduled transactions are the parent of the executed state (e.g. `APPLIED`, `REJECTED`).
- Refunds use the original transaction as their parent.

## Skip transaction queue

<Info>Available in version 0.8.2 and later.</Info>

The `skip_queue` feature allows you to bypass the default transaction queuing system and immediately process transactions directly. This is useful for scenarios where you need real-time transaction processing while still maintaining data consistency.

To enable this feature, include "skip_queue": true in the request body when calling the [Create Transaction](/reference/create-transaction.mdx) endpoint:

```json {6}
{
  "amount": 102.12,
  "precision": 100,
  ...
  "allow_overdraft": true,
  "skip_queue": true
}
```

### How it works

When you enable `skip_queue`, the transaction:

* Bypasses the normal queuing process
* Executes immediately on the balance
* Uses distributed locks via Redis to maintain consistency
* Applies optimistic locking at the database level

### Example applications

Use `skip_queue` when:

* Processing low-volume transactions with minimal balance contention;
* You need synchronous confirmation of transaction completion;
* Time-sensitive financial operations.

<Tip>We recommend using queues for high traffic scenarios to avoid lock errors. Learn how: [Handling Hot Balances](/guides/hot-balances#option-1-use-the-queue-recommended)</Tip>
