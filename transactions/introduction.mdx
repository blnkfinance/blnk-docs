## Overview

Transactions are used to enable money movement between two or more balances. These can be payments, transfers, settlements, internal treasury management, etc. All transactions in Blnk are recorded with the [double entry principle](/resources/double-entry), i.e., there is a source and a corresponding destination for each transaction entry. 

In this guide, you'll learn:

1. [Transaction properties](#transaction-properties)
2. [Recording a transaction](#recording-a-transaction)
3. [How transactions work in Blnk](#how-transactions-work-in-blnk)
4. [Managing insufficient funds](#managing-insufficient-funds)

## Transaction properties

1. **Immutability:** Once recorded, transactions in Blnk cannot be modified or deleted. This fundamental property ensures the integrity and reliability of your transaction history, preventing any unauthorized alterations. See also: [Transaction hashing](/advanced/transaction-hashing)

2. **Idempotency:** Each transaction in Blnk produces the same result whether executed once or multiple times. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially during network failures or system retries.
  
    <Warning>
      Blnk implements idempotency by requiring a unique `reference` for every transaction. This reference serves as a transaction identifier, preventing duplicate processing and ensuring consistent outcomes.
    </Warning>

## Recording a transaction

To record a transaction, call the **record-transaction** endpoint: 

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions
```

With the following request body:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request {9}
{
    "amount": 750,
    "reference": "ref_001adcfgf",
    "currency": "USD",
    "precision": 100,
    "source": "@FundingPool",
    "destination": "bln_ebcd230f-6265-4d4a-a4ca-45974c47f746",
    "description": "Fund with starting balance amount",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "meta_data": {
      "sender_name": "John Doe",
      "sender_account": "00000000000"
    }
}
```
```sh Blnk CLI {9}
blnk transactions create
? Amount: <amount>
? Precision: <precision>
? Reference: <reference>
? Description: <description>
? Currency: <currency>
? Source: <source>
? Destination: <destination>
? Allow overdraft: (y)
? Inflight: (n)
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
If this is your first transaction, the participating balances will start at 0. To ensure the transaction is successful, enable overdrafts as shown above, allowing the source balance to go negative.

Learn more about [Overdrafts](/transactions/overdrafts) and [Negative Balances](/resources/negative-balances).

## How transactions work in Blnk

Every transaction goes through multiple states in Blnk, and each state change is recorded as a separate record in the database. This gives you complete traceability, allowing to see the lifecycle of a transaction from initiation to completion. 

Each state is connected to the previous state through a `parent_transaction` attribute. Here's how it works:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Transaction lifecycle">
    By default, every transaction begins in a `QUEUED` state.

    <Tip>You can choose to skip this `QUEUED` state altogether and directly process your transactions. Learn more: [Skip Transaction Queue](#skip-transaction-queue)</Tip>
    
    Within milliseconds of being queued, Blnk processes it and transitions it to one of three possible states:

    * `INFLIGHT`: If the transaction request includes `"inflight": "true"`.
        * `APPLIED`: If the inflight transaction is committed.
        * `VOID`: If the inflight transaction is voided.
    * `APPLIED`: When the transaction is completed and applied to the balances.
    * `REJECTED`: When the transaction is not processed due to reasons like insufficient funds.

    Here's an example response when you record a new transaction on Blnk:

    ```json Record transaction response {13}
    {
      "precise_amount": 10000000,
      "amount": 100000,
      "rate": 0,
      "precision": 100,
      "transaction_id": "txn_d4951810-706c-44d1-be45-6f254be0e167",
      "parent_transaction": "",
      "source": "bln_7769aedf-bc88-49f7-bbb2-118f121daee6",
      "destination": "bln_c42e4bbd-4ea9-494a-89be-7634b0c1e41a",
      "reference": "ref_e55c4f33-bff7-4c30-9b9f-5d2d10a29b7a",
      "currency": "USD",
      "description": "Sample transaction",
      "status": "QUEUED",
      "hash": "3ef19e9cd9aba07d33068d096da1e1596f1270a70c9aa2d160206b4d6da553dc",
      "allow_overdraft": true,
      "inflight": false,
      "created_at": "2025-02-02T02:35:16.606614793Z",
      "scheduled_for": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "inflight_expiry_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Record creation and tracking">
    When a transaction moves to its next state (`INFLIGHT`, `APPLIED`, or `REJECTED`), Blnk creates a new record that maintains a connection to the original queued transaction. This connection is maintained in two ways:

    1. **Parent-Child Relationship:** The new record's `parent_transaction` field stores the original transaction's `transaction_id`. This creates a clear lineage between related transaction records.
    2. **Reference Tracking:** To ensure each record remains uniquely identifiable while preserving its relationship to other states, Blnk:
        * Uses the same base reference as the original transaction.
        * Appends a `_q` suffix to create a unique reference.

    For example, if the original transaction has:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "transaction_id": "txn_123",
      "reference": "payment_abc"
    }
    ```

    The next state's record would have:

    ```json 
    {
      ...
      "parent_transaction": "txn_123",
      "reference": "payment_abc_q"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tracking transaction status">
    You can track the final state of your transactions using either of these methods:

    1. **Reference Search:** Query transactions using the original reference. Blnk will return the `INFLIGHT` or `APPLIED` record associated with that reference.
        ```json
        {
          "q": "payment_abc",
          "query_by": "reference"
        }
        ```
    2. **Parent Transaction Search:** Look up transactions using the original `transaction_id` as a parent transaction identifier. This returns the same result as the reference search but uses the parent-child relationship instead of the reference string.
        ```json
        {
          "q": "txn_123",
          "query_by": "parent_transaction"
        }
        ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discarded transactions">
    A discarded transaction is not recorded in the ledger. Blnk discards transactions for one reason:

    1. **Duplicate reference:** Your new transaction `reference` matches an existing `reference` in your ledger. Blnk requires unique `reference` values per transaction. Options are timestamps (e.g. UNIX timestamp), random string or UUID (e.g. `ref_e55c4f33-bff7-4c30-9b9f-5d2d10a29b7a`), or a business identifier like an `order_id`.

    <Tip>Make sure your request body match the Blnk Ledger API specifications. For example, avoid passing `apply_overdraft` instead of `allow_overdraft`.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Skip transaction queue

<Info>Available in version 0.8.2 and later.</Info>

The `skip_queue` feature allows you to bypass the default transaction queuing system outlined above and process transactions directly. This is useful for scenarios where you need real-time transaction processing while still maintaining data consistency.

To enable this feature, include "skip_queue": true in the request body when calling the [Create Transaction](/reference/create-transaction.mdx) endpoint:

```json {6}
{
  "amount": 102.12,
  "precision": 100,
  ...
  "allow_overdraft": true,
  "skip_queue": true
}
```

### How it works

When you enable `skip_queue`, the transaction:

* Bypasses the normal queuing process
* Executes immediately on the balance
* Uses distributed locks via Redis to maintain consistency
* Applies optimistic locking at the database level

### Example applications

Use `skip_queue` when:

* Processing low-volume transactions with minimal balance contention;
* You need synchronous confirmation of transaction completion;
* Time-sensitive financial operations.

<Tip>We recommend using queues for high traffic scenarios to avoid lock errors. Learn how: [Understanding Queues](/guides/queues#handling-high-traffic-balances)</Tip>

## Managing insufficient funds

You can handle insufficient funds scenarios in two ways: through automatic rejection handling when transactions are attempted with insufficient balance, and through proactive balance checking before initiating transactions.

### 1. Automatic rejection

When a transaction is posted where the `source` balance has insufficient funds, Bink automatically handles this scenario to maintain ledger integrity. Blnk:

1. Rejects the transaction.
2. Records this rejection in your ledger using the same state tracking mechanism we discussed above (i.e. `QUEUED` â†’ `REJECTED`).
3. Sends a webhook notification to inform your system of the state change and new ledger record.

<Tip>You can also preemptively track the transaction status (via `reference` or `parent_transaction`) to know if the transaction was successful or rejected.</Tip>

### 2. Proactive balance verification

Instead of waiting for a `transaction.rejected` webhook, you can implement a preemptive available balance check in your workflow. Here's how:

First, query the balance of the sender using:

```
GET /balances/{balance_id}?with_queued=true
```

Next, calculate your available balance: 
```
available_balance = balance - queued_debit_balance
```

* If the available balance is sufficient, proceed with posting your transaction.
* If the available balance is insufficient, you can gracefully handle this scenario in your application by notifying the customer immediately, avoiding the need for webhook handling.
