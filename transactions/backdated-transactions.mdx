## Overview

The `effective_date` feature is a critical functionality in financial systems that allows recording transactions with a financial date different from their system entry date. 

This capability ensures seamless migration, accurate financial reporting, reconciliation, and historical balance calculations.

### Effective date vs created date

When `effective_date` isn't specified, the system automatically uses the created date as the effective date.

* `created_at`: Timestamp of when the transaction was recorded in the system.
* `effective_date`: The actual financial date when the transaction occurred

### Create transaction with effective date

Call the [Record Transaction](/reference/create-transaction) endpoint:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/transactions
```

  <Tab title="Request body">
  ```json {9}
  {
    "amount": 358.90,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "unique_reference_1",
    "description": "Backdated transaction",
    "currency": "NGN",

    "destination": "@destination_account",
    "effective_date": "2025-02-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
  ```

  <Tip>
    Use the `effective_date` field (optional, string) to specify the date a transaction financially occurred, formatted in ISO 8601 (e.g., "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z"). 
    
    If left blank, the system will automatically use the current timestamp.

## Balance calculations

In this section, you'll learn how this affects how balances calculated.

### Current Running Balance

* Backdated transactions immediately update the current running balance.
* The running balance always reflects the most up-to-date financial position based on all known transactions.

### Example

* Current balance before backdated transaction: `$500`.
* Record a `$200` transaction with an `effective_date` from last month.
* Current balance after: `$700`.

### Historical Balance Queries

When querying a balance at a specific point in time, the system:

1. Starts with the most recent snapshot before the requested time
2. Applies all transactions with an `effective_date` on or before the requested time
3. Ignores transactions with an `effective_date` after the requested time

```json Response example
{
  "balance_id": "bln_a03ef6af-1e5d-46a8-86a9-5fb1f2286f66",
  "balance": "1245.67",
  "credit_balance": "2000.00",
  "debit_balance": "754.33",
  "currency": "NGN",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-01T13:19:26Z"
}
```

In this example historical balance calculation includes:

* All transactions with `effective_date` on or before March 1st, 2025.
*  Transactions recorded after March 1st are included if their effective date is on or before that date.

## Common use cases

Here are some use cases for backdating transactions:

1. **Late-arriving transactions:** Record transactions that occurred in the past but were discovered later, ensuring historical accuracy with backdated entries.
2. **Month-end reconciliation:** Attribute transactions to the correct fiscal period by backdating them, maintaining accurate financial records for period-end reporting.
3. **Financial reporting:** Generate precise reports for specific time periods by backdating transactions to reflect their true financial occurrence, improving data integrity.
4. **Audit compliance:** Maintain historically accurate records for auditing purposes by backdating transactions, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
5. **Error correction:** Rectify mistakes or omissions in past records by backdating transactions to their original dates, preserving ledger accuracy. See also: [Adjusting Balances →](/balances/adjusting-balances).
6. **Historical analysis:** Support retrospective financial analysis or trend tracking by backdating transactions, enabling accurate insights into past performance.

## Best practices & constraints

### Important Considerations

* Backdated transactions immediately impact the running balance.
* The `effective_date`:
    * Can be in the past.
    * Must not be in the future. Use `scheduled_for` instead to schedule transactions in the future. Learn how: [Scheduling Transactions →](/transactions/scheduling).
    * Defaults to the current system time if not specified.

### Error Handling

Invalid effective date error:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid effective_date: must not be in the future",
  "status": 400
}
```
