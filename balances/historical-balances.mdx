## Overview

The [Historical Balances](/reference/historical-balances) endpoint allows users to retrieve balances (identified by `balance_id`) at a particular historical point in time, specified by the timestamp parameter.

It leverages Blnk's balance snapshot feature to provide accurate historical data for financial reporting, auditing, or analysis.

```
GET http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances/{balance_id}/at?timestamp={timestamp}
```

<Tip>
  Always format the date input as 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00' (e.g., 2024-04-22T15:28:03+00:00), where `+00:00` specifies the timezone. It is UTC by default.
</Tip>

```json Example response

    "credit_balance": 9620000,

    "debit_balance": 0,
    "ledger_id": ""
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-02-24T08:55:26Z"
}
```

## How it works

When querying for a balance at a specific timestamp, Blnk follows these steps to ensure accuracy and reliability:

1. **Identify the most recent snapshot:** The system retrieves the most recent snapshot taken before the requested timestamp. Snapshots are daily records of balances, captured manually by users as described in the Balance Snapshots feature.

    <Warning>If no snapshot is found, Blnk builds the historical balance from genesis (using transactions only).</Warning>
    
2. **Apply intervening transactions:** It then applies all transactions that occurred between the time of the snapshot and the requested timestamp. This reconstructs the balance state by accounting for any credits, debits, or other financial activities that took place during that period.

3. **Return the computed balance:** The final computed balance, reflecting the exact state at the requested timestamp, is returned in the response.

### Reconstruct balances from source

<Info>Available on version 0.10.1 or later.</Info>

You can choose to bypass balance snapshots and directly reconstruct your balances from their transactions alone. 

To do this, include the query parameter `from_source=true` in your request URL:

```
GET http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances/{balance_id}/at?timestamp={timestamp}&from_source=true
```
