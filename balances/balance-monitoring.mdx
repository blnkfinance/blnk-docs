Balance monitors let you keep track of balances in your Blnk Ledger. This is useful for scenarios where balances should meet specific thresholds.

You can monitor all 3 sub-balances of a ledger balance — credit balance (`credit_balance`), debit balance (`debit_balance`) and total balance (`balance`). 

**Let's get started ✨**

What we'll cover …

1. [Why monitor balances?](#1-why-monitor-balances)
2. [Set up balance monitors](#2-set-up-balance-monitors)
3. [Supported operators](#3-supported-operators)
4. [Manage existing balance monitors](#4-manage-existing-balance-monitors)

## 1. Why monitor balances?

1. **Fraud detection:** Unusual balance changes can be an early indication of fraudulent activities. Monitoring can trigger alerts for suspicious transactions and ensure timely intervention.

2. **Regulatory compliance:** Many financial regulations require institutions to maintain specific balance thresholds. Real-time balance monitoring makes it easy to comply with these regulations.

3. **Customer notifications:** Customers can be notified in real-time if their balance crosses a specific threshold. It can also be used for segmenting your customers in your application.

4. **Operational efficiency:** Instantly knowing when a balance reaches a certain threshold can trigger automatic actions, such as transferring funds between accounts or purchasing assets.

## 2. Set up balance monitors

To set up balance monitoring, you need to determine your conditions, e.g., notify me when the `debit_balance` is above 100000.

Next, call the **create-balance-monitor** endpoint and provide the following request body:

```
POST http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balance-monitors
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/balance-monitors" \
  -H "X-blnk-key: <api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "condition": {
        "field": "debit_balance",
        "operator": ">",
        "value": 1000,
        "precision": 100
    },
    "description": "Tier 1 Account"
  }'
```

| Field | Description | Required? | Type
| :--- |:--- | :--- | :---
| `balance_id` | Unique identifier of the balance to be monitored. | Yes | `string`
| `condition` | Object representing the condition to be satisfied. | Yes
| `field` | Specific sub-balance to monitor. It can be `debit_balance`, `credit_balance`, or `balance`. | Yes | `string`
| `operator` |  Indicates the comparison operation to be performed between the field and operator. **See below → [Supported operators](#supported-operators).** | Yes | `string`
| `value` | The value against which the `field` is compared. | Yes | `int64`
| `precision` | Converts the value to lowest possible unit. Ensure that the precision specified is the same as the precision applied to the balance | Yes | `int64`
| `description` | Description of your balance monitor. It is left empty if it's not passed in the request. | No | `string`

In this example, Blnk is asked to monitor the balance and send a notification when its `debit_balance` is greater than 100000.

<Note>
    You can also include a `meta_data` in your request if you need to add custom data to your balance monitor.
</Note>

Once the request is received, Blnk stores your balance monitor with a unique `monitor_id`. When the condition is met, you will get instantly notified via the `balance.monitor` webhook event.

```json Response
{
    "monitor_id": "mon_e0e77b0c-4985-472a-9bf5-76a48b0259b0",
    "balance_id": "bln_0be360ca-86fe-457d-be43-daa3f966d8f0",
    "condition": {
        "field": "debit_balance",
        "operator": ">",
        "value": 1000000
    },
    "description": "Tier 1 Account",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20T05:56:58.257315054Z"
}
```

| Field | Description | Type
| :--- | :--- | :---
| `monitor_id` | Unique identifier for your balance monitor. | `string`
| `created_at` | Date and time of creation. | `string` 

## 3. Supported operators

This is a list of all supported operators by the Balance monitor:

|Operators|Symbol|Description
|:------|:------|:------|
|Greater than|>|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is greater than `value`
|Less than|&lt;|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is less than `value`
|Equal to|=|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is exactly equal to `value`
|Not equal to|!=| Checks if the specified balance in `field` is not equal to `value`
|Greater than or equal to|>=|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is greater than or equal to `value`
|Less than or equal to|&lt;=|Checks if the specified balance in `field` is less than or equal to `value`

## 4. Manage existing balance monitors

You can request to view or update the details of a particular monitor.

To view balance monitors, call the **get-balance-monitor** endpoint:

```
GET http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balance-monitors/{monitor-id}
```

<Tip>
    `GET http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balance-monitors` will return a list of all balance monitors.
</Tip>

To update a balance monitor, call the **update-balance-monitor** endpoint:

```
PUT http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balance-monitors/{monitor-id}
```

and provided the updated conditions in the request body.
