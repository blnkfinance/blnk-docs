Blnk enables you to create and link multiple balances to a single identity within your Ledger. Any transaction record associated with a linked balance is also automatically mapped to the corresponding identity.

## Link an identity to a balance

To create a balance connected to an identity, include the `identity_id` of the identity you want to associate with the balance in the request body of the **create-balance** endpoint as shown below:

```json Request {3}
{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
    "identity_id": "idt_0501db5c-baf9-4be1-a931-f4bae7f3a41d",
    "currency": "USD"
}
```

```json Response {11}

    "inflight_balance": 0,
