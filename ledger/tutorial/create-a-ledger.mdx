## Overview

Everything in Blnk begins with a ledger and this guide shows you how to create and view a ledger in your Blnk server. 

## Before you start

Make sure you have read and understood how [the Blnk Ledger](/ledger/overview) works. If you are confused or have any questions, please [join our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-1tr5864/shared_invite/zt-2d9oejhwl-6VJsXV7Vmy0mCX2vzBXnWA) and share your questions in a relevant channel.

## Create a ledger
<Steps>
	<Step title="Decide a name for the ledger">
		Send a request to the [create-ledger](/misc/create-ledger) endpoint with the following fields:
		
		```json request
		{
		    "name": "Customer Wallets Ledger",
		    "meta_data": {
		        "project_owner": "Blnk Tech"
		    }
		}
		```
		
		| Field | Description | Required | Type
		| --- | --- | --- | ---
		| `name` | A name that best describes the function of the ledger | Yes | `string`
	</Step>
	<Step title="Your ledger gets created">
		Once your ledger has been created, you can move on to create a balance connected to the ledger. 
		
		```json response
		{
		    "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
		    "name": "Customer Wallets Ledger",
		    "created_at": "2024-02-20 05:28:03 UTC",
		    "meta_data":{
			    "project_owner": "Blnk Tech"
		    }
		}
		```
		| Field | Description | Type
		| --- | --- | --- 
		| `ledger_id` | Unique identification number for your ledger | `string`
		| `name` | The name of your ledger | `string`
		| `created_at` | Date and time of when it was created | `string`
	</Step>
</Steps>

## View your ledger

To view details of a ledger in your Blnk server this, call the [Get Ledgers](/misc/get-ledger) endpoint URL — `/ledgers/[ledger_id]`. Provide the `ledger_id` to see the details of a specific ledger.
