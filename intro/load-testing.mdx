### Overview

Use load testing to ensure that your Blnk deployment can handle expected traffic and maintain performance under various conditions. This is a critical step in setting up your Blnk server.

Blnk use [k6](https://k6.io), a modern loading testing tool to manage this process. This guide will walk you through setting up and running a load test on your Blnk server using [k6](https://k6.io) with insights from a sample test result to help you understand and interpret your data.

### Before you start

Make sure you have:

1. Cloned the Blnk repository to your local machine;
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed, for running the Blnk server;
3. k6 installed on your machine. Visit [k6.io](https://k6.io) for installation instructions.

### Set up your load test
<Steps>
	<Step title="Clone the Blnk repository">
		If the Blnk repository isn't already cloned:
		
		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/jerry-enebeli/Blnk && cd Blnk
		```
		
		Deploy your Blnk server if you haven't done so yet:
		<Card title="Deploy Blnk" icon="square-1" href="/intro/run-blnk-server">
        Start here to run your Blnk server
		</Card>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Navigate to the load test directory">
		Switch to the load test folder within the Blnk repository
		
		```bash
		cd tests/load
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Review the load test script">
		The `script.js` file in the load test directory outlines the test:
		
		- It sends HTTP POST requests to the `/transactions` endpoint of the Blnk server.
		- Each request simulates a transaction with a unique reference ID, generated sing the `uuidv4` function.
		- The script is set to run with 5 virtual users (VUs) for 30 seconds.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Load test script (script.js)">
		```javascript
		import http from "k6/http";
		import { uuidv4 } from 'https://jslib.k6.io/k6-utils/1.4.0/index.js';
		import { check, sleep } from "k6";
		
		export const options = {
		    vus: 5,
		    duration: '30s',
		};
		
		export default function () {
		    const url = 'http://localhost:5001/transactions';
		    const payload = JSON.stringify({
		        "amount": 100,
		        "allow_over_draft": true,
		        "reference": uuidv4(),
		        "currency": "NGN",
		        "source": "@cash",
		        "destination": "@interests"
		    });
		
		    const params = {
		        headers: {
		            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		        },
		    };
		
		    let response = http.post(url, payload, params);
		    check(response, {
		        'is status 201': r => r.status === 201,
		    });
		}
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Run the load test">
		Within the `tests/load` directory:
		
		```bash
		k6 run script.js
		```
	</Step>
</Steps>
