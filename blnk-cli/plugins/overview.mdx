    **Important to note:** This is an experimental feature.

Plugins enhance and extend the capabilities of your Blnk Ledger by providing additional features and functionalities tailored to meet your needs. In this guide, you'll learn all about plugins, and how to install and run plugins on your server. 

Just like the Blnk Ledger, Plugins are also open-source. You can develop your own plugins for your project, but we require you to publish it on the [Blnk Plugin public repository](https://github.com/blnkledger/blnk-plugins) to be able to run them on your project using the [Blnk CLI](/blnk-cli/install).

## Installation

To install a plugin, run this command in your terminal

```bash bash
blnk plugins install <pluginName>
```

You can find the name of the plugin file in the [Blnk Plugin public repository.](https://github.com/blnkfinance/blnk-plugins)

## Basic commands

There are 4 basic commands that you can use to manage your installed plugins.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Run plugin">
        ```bash bash
        blnk plugins run <pluginName>
        ```
        This command manually runs the plugin for you in the terminal.

        <Note>
            When you run a plugin on a connected instance from your computer, the plugin is run on where the instance is hosted on.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update plugin">
        ```bash bash
        blnk plugins update <pluginName>
        ```
        This command updates the plugin to its latest version, if any.
    </Step>
    <Step title="List installed plugins">
        ```bash bash
        blnk plugins list
        ```
        This command shows you a list of all your installed plugins and their basic information.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Delete plugin">
        ```bash bash
        blnk plugins delete <pluginName>
        ```
        This command deletes a plugin from your list of installed plugin.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical example

In this example, we'll install the "Hello World" sample plugin. This plugin simply prints "Hello World" once it is run.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the hello-world plugin">
        ```bash bash
        blnk plugins install hello-world
        ```
        When it's done, you get the following:
        ```bash Output
        ✔ Plugin hello-world installed successfully.
        Warning: Plugin hello-world is not verified by Blnk. Use with caution.
        ```

        <Note>
            While everyone is welcome to publish their plugins and contribute to Blnk's open-source plugin directory, all plugins will go through an internal review process to verify their safety and ensure the security of our customers' ledgers. 
            
            The warning sign is shown when the plugin has not yet been verified by the Blnk team.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the command">
        ```bash bash
        blnk plugins run hello-world
        ```
        Here's the response you get:
        ```bash response
        ⠋ Running plugin hello-world...Hello World Plugin initialized
        Hello World Plugin executed with event data: http://localhost:5001
        ✔ Plugin hello-world executed successfully.
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
