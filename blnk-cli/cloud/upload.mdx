Vault allows developers to upload, validate and save identity documents in their ledger for easy reference. With vault, developers can:

- Securely upload and validate identity documents.
- Extract data from identity documents for use.
- Check for duplicates, i.e., if that document has been previously uploaded before.

## Uploading to Vault

To upload to Vault using the CLI, here's the command syntax:

```sh Shell
blnk cloud upload <file-path> <options>
```

| Fields | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<file-path>` | This is the file location of the document you want to upload. You can upload .pdf, .docx, or .png files. |
| `<options>` | A set of optional parameters that modify the behavior of the command. |

| Options | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-t or --type <type>` | String |  Specifies the type of document you are uploading. If no type is specified, it defaults to “passport”. |
| `-v or --use-vision <useVision>` | Boolean | Enable (true) or disable (false) vision processing. Vision processing is disabled by default. |
| `-d or --duplicate-check <duplicateCheck>` | Boolean | Check for duplicate files before uploading. It is enabled (true) by default. |

Here's a sample command:

```sh Shell
blnk cloud upload /path/to/file.pdf -t id_card -v true -d false
```
