The Blnk Cloud is a software that allows you to manage your ledger and access advanced features for your financial backend. You can use the cloud to:

- Enable anomaly detection on your ledgers and balances.
- Collaborate with other non-technical members of your team like operations, customer service, etc.
- Upload data to your vault.
- See data tables and insights of your financial data (ledgers, balances, and transactions).

To use the Blnk CLI with the cloud, ensure that you have [installed the CLI on your machine.](../install)

## 1. Log in to Cloud

Logged in successfully. You can now use cloud commands.
