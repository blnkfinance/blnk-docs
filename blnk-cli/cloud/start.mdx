The Blnk Cloud is a software that allows you to manage your ledger and access advanced features for your financial backend. You can use the cloud to:

- Enable anomaly detection on your ledgers and balances.
- Collaborate with other non-technical members of your team like operations, customer service, etc.
- Upload data to your vault.
- See data tables and insights of your financial data (ledgers, balances, and transactions).

To use the Blnk CLI with the cloud, ensure that you have [installed the CLI on your machine.](/blnk-cli/install)

## 1. Log in to Cloud

Ensure you already have a Blnk Cloud account setup to do this. To log in to Cloud from the CLI:

```sh Shell
blnk cloud login
```
```sh Output
Email: <cloud-email>
Password: <cloud-password>
Authentication successful.
Logged in successfully. You can now use cloud commands.
```

<Note>
    You cannot use `blnk cloud` commands without logging in to your cloud.
</Note>

## 2. Log out from Cloud

To log out from Cloud:
```sh Shell
blnk cloud logout
```
```sh Output
Logout successful. You have been logged out and the token has been cleared.
```
