<Tip>
    To use Anomalies on the Blnk CLI, ensure that you have enabled anomalies on your Cloud account. 
</Tip>

Anomaly Detection is a Cloud feature that allows developers to get notified when something different from expected normal happens in a ledger or ledger balance. 

When you run the `blnk cloud anomalies` or `blnk cloud la` for short, you can view a list of all anomalies detected in your ledger. 

```sh Shell
blnk cloud anomalies
```
