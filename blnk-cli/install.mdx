The Blnk CLI is a developer tool that helps you to build, test, and manage your Blnk installation directly from the command line. With the CLI, you can easily test your deployment, search your financial data, sync your server to the cloud, connect to local and remote instances, and so much more.

Let's get started ✨

1. [Installing the Blnk CLI](#1-installing-the-blnk-cli)
2. [Connecting instances](#2-connecting-instances)

## 1. Installing the Blnk CLI

To use the Blnk CLI, you need to first have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blnk-cli) downloaded on your machine.

Next, install the Blnk CLI via your terminal into the same location as your ledger:

```sh Shell
npm i -g @blnkfinance/blnk-cli
```

Next, confirm your installation by checking for the version you've downloaded:

```sh Shell
blnk --version
```
```sh Output
1.6.0
```

## 2. Connecting instances

To connect to an instance with the CLI, ensure that Blnk has been installed on your server (local or cloud). If you have Blnk running locally on your computer, your default connection url is `https://localhost:5001/`.

To connect to a different instance url:

```sh Shell
blnk connect <url>
```

You can also choose to connect to a [secure installation of the Blnk Ledger](../advanced/secure-blnk). To do this:

```sh Shell
blnk connect-secure <instance-url> <api-token>
```

Next, confirm that you have successfully connected to an instance:

```sh Shell
blnk info
```
```sh Output
Current Server Connection:
Instance URL: http://localhost:5001
API Token: Not set
```
