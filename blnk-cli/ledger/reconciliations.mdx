Use the `blnk reconciliations` command to create and manage reconciliations in your Blnk server. 

<Note>
    Ensure that your Blnk server is running and connected to the CLI to use this command.
</Note>

## 1. View reconciliations

To view all of the reconciliations in your server:

```sh Shell
blnk reconciliations list
```

<Note>
    For creating new reconciliations, please use the API. Refer to our docs on [reconciliations](/reconciliations/overview).
</Note>

## 2. Search reconciliations

[Search](/search/overview) is used to query and find data in your Blnk server. To search your reconciliations with the Blnk CLI, you can use the following options with the `blnk reconciliations list` command.

| Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p or --page <number>` | Page number (default: "1") |
| `--per-page <number>` | Results per page (default: "10") |
| `-s or --search <term>` | What you are searching for (default: "*") |
| `-q or --query-by <fields>` | Fields to query your search term by (default: "reconciliation_id, upload_id") |

For example, the command below displays all completed reconciliations in your ledger

```sh Shell
blnk reconciliations list -s "COMPLETED" -q "status"
```
