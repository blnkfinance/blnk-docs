Use the `blnk transactions` command to create and manage transactions in your Blnk server. 

<Note>
    Ensure that your Blnk server is running and connected to the CLI to use this command.
</Note>

## 1: Create new transaction

To create a new transaction:

```sh Shell
blnk transactions create
```
```sh Output
? Amount: <amount>
? Precision: <precision>
? Reference: <reference>
? Description: <description>
? Currency: <currency>
? Source: <source>
? Destination: <destination>
? Allow overdraft: (y/n)
? Inflight: (y/n)
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<amount>` | The transaction amount. |
| `<precision>` | Precision for the currency/asset passed. See also: [Precision](/transactions/precision). |
| `<reference>` | Your unique reference to ensure idempotency. |
| `<description>` | The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to. |
| `<currency>` | Short code for your asset class. |
| `<source>` | Sender’s balance ID. |
| `<destination>` | Recipient's balance ID. |
| `<allow overdraft>` | "y" if you want to enable overdraft, "n" if otherwise. |
| `<inflight>` | "y" if you want to enable inflight, "n" if otherwise. |
| `<metadata>` | Custom info written in JSON format . If you have no metadata, you can leave it blank like this: `{}` |

A new transaction record is now created and added to your ledger.

<Note>
    For creating more complex transactions, please use the API.
</Note>

## 2: View transactions

To view all of the transactions in your server:

```sh Shell
blnk transactions list
```

## 3: Search transactions

[Search](/search/typesense/overview) is used to query and find data in your Blnk server. To search your transactions with the Blnk CLI, you can use the following options with the `blnk transactions list` command.

| Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p or --page <number>` | Page number (default: "1") |
| `--per-page <number>` | Results per page (default: "10") |
| `-s or --search <term>` | What you are searching for (default: "*") |
| `-q or --query-by <fields>` | Fields to query your search term by (default: "reference, source, destination") |

For example, the command below displays your latest 50 transactions instead of the default 10.

```sh Shell
blnk transactions list --per-page 50
```
