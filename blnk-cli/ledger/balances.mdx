Use the `blnk balances` command to create and manage balances in your Blnk server. 

<Note>
    Ensure that your Blnk server is running and connected to the CLI to use this command.
</Note>

## 1. Create new balance

To create a new balance:

```sh Shell
blnk balances create
```
```sh Output
? Ledger ID: <ledger-id>
? Currency: <currency>
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<ledger-id>` | The unique id of the ledger that this balance belongs to.	 |
| `<currency>` | The currency in which transactions recorded in this balance will be recorded. |
| `<metadata>` | Custom info written in JSON format, e.g. `{"first_name":"Sandra", "last_name":"Baileys"}`. If you have no metadata, you can leave it blank like this: `{}` |

A new balance is now created and added to your ledger.

## 2. View balances

To view all of the balances in your server:

```sh Shell
blnk balances list
```

## 3. Search balances

[Search](/search/overview) is used to query and find data in your Blnk server. To search your balances with the Blnk CLI, you can use the following options with the `blnk balances list` command.

| Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p or --page <number>` | Page number (default: "1") |
| `--per-page <number>` | Results per page (default: "10") |
| `-s or --search <term>` | What you are searching for (default: "*") |
| `-q or --query-by <fields>` | Fields to query your search term by (default: "currency, balance_id") |

For example, the command below searches for a ledger balance with a specific balance_id in your Blnk server:

```sh Shell
blnk balances list -s "<balance_id>"
```
