Use the `blnk ledgers` command to create and manage ledgers in your Blnk server. 

<Note>
    Ensure that your Blnk server is running and connected to the CLI to use this command.
</Note>

## 1. Create new ledger

To create a new ledger:

```sh Shell
blnk ledgers create
```
```sh Output
? Ledger Name: <ledger-name>
? Metadata (JSON format): <metadata>
```

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<ledger-name>` | The name of the ledger |
| `<metadata>` | Custom info written in JSON format, e.g. `{"owner":"Acme Inc", "ledgerYear":"2024"}`. If you have no metadata, you can leave it blank like this: `{}` |

A new ledger is now created and added to your server.

## 2. View ledgers

To view all of the ledgers in your server:

```sh Shell
blnk ledgers list
```

## 3. Search ledgers

[Search](/search/overview) is used to query and find data in your Blnk server. To search your ledgers with the Blnk CLI, you can use the following options with the `blnk ledgers list` command.

| Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p or --page <number>` | Page number (default: "1") |
| `--per-page <number>` | Results per page (default: "10") |
| `-s or --search <term>` | What you are searching for (default: "*") |
| `-q or --query-by <fields>` | Fields to query your search term by (default: "name, ledger_id") |

For example, the command below searches for a ledger named "Main Ledger" in your Blnk server:

```sh Shell
blnk ledgers list -s "Main Ledger" -q "name"
```
