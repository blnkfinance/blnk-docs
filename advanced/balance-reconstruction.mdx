## Overview

Balance Reconstruction helps you solve situations where your balances go out of sync and you have to rebuild the balance from the ground up. It does this by recalculating a balance from its transactions to ensure it correctly reflects all recorded activity.

---

## Reconstructing a balance

To reconstruct a balance, update its metadata with the following request:

```
POST https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/{balance_id}/metadata
```
```json
{
  "meta_data": {
    "BLNK_RUN_RECONCILIATION": "SOURCE"
  }
}
```

---

## Verifying the results

To check the results, retrieve the balance details with the [Get Balance](/reference/get-balance) endpoint:

```
GET https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances/{balance_id}
```

The results will be available in the `meta_data` object:

```json Response
{
  "meta_data": {
    "BLNK_RECONCILIATION_RESULT": {
      "difference": "103842",
      "executed_at": "2025-03-16 22:55:34.281624+00",
      "previous_balance": "600",
      "previous_credit": "1200",
      "previous_debit": "600",
      "recalculated_balance": "104442",
      "recalculated_credit": "119600",
      "recalculated_debit": "15158"
    }
  }
}
```
