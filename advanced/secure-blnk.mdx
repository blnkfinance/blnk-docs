## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to run your Blnk server in secure mode and implement best practices for maintaining a secure environment.

Before you start, please ensure that you have a working instance of Blnk Core:

## Enable secure mode

Modify your `blnk.json` configuration file to enable secure mode. Set `server.secure` to true and provide a strong `server.secret_key`.

```json blnk.json
{
  "server": {
    "secure": true,
    "secret_key": "your_strong_secret_key"
  }
}
```

---

## Authentication methods

Blnk supports authentication via the **X-Blnk-Key header.**

### Master key authentication

The master key (`server.secret_key`) provides full access to all API endpoints. Use it only for administrative tasks and initial setup.

```bash 
curl -H "X-Blnk-Key: your_strong_secret_key" https://yourdomain.com:5001/ledgers
```

### Generating fine-grained API keys

<Info>Available on version 0.10.1 or later.</Info>

For regular operations, create API keys with specific permissions to enforce fine-grained access control.

#### Create an API key

This requires the master key authentication:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Blnk-Key: your_master_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Service Account",
    "owner": "owner_id", 
    "scopes": ["ledgers:read", "balances:write"],
    "expires_at": "2026-03-11T00:00:00Z"
  }' \
  https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL:5001/api-keys
```

| Parameter   | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `name`        | The name of the API key or service account. |
| `owner`       | Unique identifier of the owner or service associated with the API key. |
| `scopes`      | A list of permissions granted to the API key (e.g., `ledgers:read`, `balances:write`). |
| `expires_at`  | The expiration date and time for the API key in ISO 8601 format. |

#### Use the API key

```bash
curl -H "X-Blnk-Key: your_api_key" https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL:5001/ledgers
```

## Understanding Scopes

Scopes define what resources an API key can access and what actions it can perform, formatted as `resource:action`.

### Available resources

| **Resources** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- |
| `*` | All resources |
| `ledgers` | Ledger management |
| `balances` | Balance operations |
| `identities` | Identity management |
| `transactions` | Transaction processing |
| `balance-monitors` | Balance monitoring |
| `hooks` | Webhook management |
| `api-keys` | API key management |
| `search` | Search operations |
| `reconciliation` | Reconciliation tasks |
| `metadata` | Metadata management |
| `backup` | Backup operations |

### Available actions

| **Actions** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- |
| `*` | All actions |
| `read` | View operations — `GET/HEAD` |
| `write` | Modify operations — `POST/PUT/PATCH` |
| `delete` | Delete operations — `DELETE` |

### Examples

* `ledgers:read`: Can only view ledgers
* `transactions:write`: Can create/modify transactions
* `*:*`: Full access to all resources and actions

## Security best practices

### Master key management

* Use a strong, randomly generated master key
* Never share or commit it to version control
* Store it in environment variables or secret management tools
* Rotate keys regularly

### API key management

* Create separate API keys for different services
* Set expiration dates for API keys
* Grant only necessary scopes
* Regularly audit and revoke unused keys
* Monitor API key usage

### Configuration management

* Exclude `blnk.json` from version control (`.gitignore`)
* Store sensitive configurations in environment variables
* Implement secure secret rotation procedures

### Access control

* Follow the principle of least privilege
* Regularly review API key permissions
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
* Maintain audit logs of key activities

### Monitoring and auditing

* Track failed authentication attempts
* Monitor API key usage patterns
* Set up alerts for suspicious activity
* Regularly review access logs

### Regular updates

* Keep all components up to date
* Monitor security advisories
* Schedule regular maintenance windows

## Error handling

Authentication failures return specific error messages:

| **Status Code** | **Message** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **401 Unauthorized** | "Authentication required. Use X-Blnk-Key header" <br/> "Invalid API key" <br/> "API key is expired or revoked" |
| **403 Forbidden** | "Insufficient permissions for resource:action" <br/> "Unknown resource type" |

### Example error response

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions for transactions:write"
}
```
