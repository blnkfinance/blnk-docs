Deploy your Blnk server with HTTPs and protect your data and ensure the privacy and integrity of information exchanged between your server and its clients. Blnk supports HTTPs out of the box and simplifies how you secure your financial application. 

This guide helps you set up HTTPs for your Blnk server. You need a basic understanding of Docker, Compose and domain management to implement this guide.

<Note>
     **Prerequisites:**
     - Docker 20.10.11 or later
     - Compose 1.29.2 or later
     - A valid domain name pointed to your server
</Note>

## Before you start

Make sure that the Blnk server has been successfully deployed and is running on your machine.

</Card>

<Steps>
	<Step title="Update your configuration file">
		Modify your `blnk.json` configuration file to enable HTTPs. Update the SSL flag to `"ssl": true` and provide your domain and email for SSL certificate notifications. 
		
		```json blnk.json
		{
		  "server": {
		    "domain": "yourdomain.com",
		    "ssl": true,
		    "ssl_email": "your-email@example.com",
		    "port": "5001"
		  }
		}
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Ensure your domain points to your server">
		Before you continue, confirm that the DNS settings for your domain are correctly configured to point to the IP address of your server. 
		
		This is required for the automated process to successfully verify your domain and issue an SSL certificate.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Start your Blnk server">
		With your configuration file updated, start your Blnk server using Docker Compose.
		
		```bash bash
		docker compose up
		```
		
		Your Blnk server will be initiated (including the automated process of obtaining an SSL certificate for your domain). The process involves validating your domain's ownership and issuing a certificate, which is then automatically configured for use by your Blnk server.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Verifying your HTTPs set-up">
		Once your Blnk server is running, you can verify the HTTPs setup by accessing your Blnk server through a web browser or using a tool like `curl`:
		
		```bash bash
		curl https://yourdomain.com:5001 -I
		```
		
		You should see a response indicating that the HTTPS connection is successful, along with other response headers.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

With HTTPs enabled, your Blnk server is now more secure, encrypting data in transit and providing a safer environment for your financial applications. Consider the following as you continue:

1. **Monitor and renew certificates:** While Blnk automates the initial certificate setup, make sure to monitor your domain and certificates for expiration and renew them as necessary.

2. **Security best practices:** Continue to follow security best practices for your Blnk server, including keeping software up to date, managing access controls, and monitoring for unauthorized access.
