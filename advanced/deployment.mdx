Blnk is a modern financial software designed for scalability and reliability. This guide outlines deployment strategies for operations of all sizes, ranging from development setups to full-scale production systems.

---

## System architecture

Blnk operates as a distributed system with three core components:

1. **API Server:** Manages incoming HTTP requests and API operations.
2. **Worker:** Processes background jobs and handles asynchronous tasks.
3. **Migration Service:** Oversees database schema updates and management.

Supporting Infrastructure:

- **PostgreSQL:** Primary database.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and message queues.
- **Typesense:** Provides search functionality.
- **Jaeger (optional):** Enables distributed tracing.

---

## Deployment options

This guide covers two primary deployment strategies, each suited to different operational needs.

1. **Single server deployment:**
    - Development environments
    - Small to medium-scale production deployments
    - Teams with limited operational overhead
    - Quick setup requirements

2. **Kubernetes deployment:**
    - Large-scale production environments
    - High availability requirements
    - Teams with existing Kubernetes expertise
    - Systems requiring sophisticated scaling capabilities

## 1. Single Server Deployment
<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Prerequisites">
  Ensure you have the following available or installed:

  - Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer recommended)
  - Docker Engine 20.10+
  - Docker Compose 2.0+
  - Managed PostgreSQL instance
  - Managed Redis instance
</Step>
<Step title="Configuration">
  Create or update your `blnk.json` configuration file. Learn more: [Advanced configuration](/advanced/configuration)

  ```json blnk.json
  {
    "project_name": "Blnk",
    "data_source": {
      "dns": "postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:5432/blnk?sslmode=require"
    },
    "redis": {
      "dns": "redis://:<password>@<host>:6379"
    },
    "typesense": {
      "dns": "http://typesense:8108"
    },
    "server": {
      "port": "5001",

      "monitoring_port": "5004"
    }
  }
  ```
</Step>
<Step title='Create a "docker-compose.yml" file'>
  Copy and paste the following configuration into your file to get started. This setup includes the API server, worker, and migration services for seamless deployment.

  ```yaml docker-compose.yml [expandable]

## 2. Kubernetes Deployment

Blnk provides comprehensive Kubernetes manifests for streamlined deployment and management in containerized environments. These manifests help you quickly set up, scale, and manage Blnk in production or development clusters.

You can find the official manifests and instructions here:

<Card href="https://github.com/blnkfinance/blnk/tree/main/infrastructure/k8s-manifests" iconType="duotone" icon="github" title="infrastructure/k8s-manifests">
  Blnk Kubernetes Manifests
</Card>

Once kubctl is installed, run the following commands:

```bash kubectl
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s-manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s-manifests
```

    - Regular security updates
2. Access Control
    - Implement proper authentication
    - Use role-based access control
    - Regular audit of access patterns

### 2. Monitoring
1. System Metrics
    - CPU utilization
    - Memory usage
    - Disk I/O
    - Network traffic
2. Application Metrics
    - Request latency
    - Error rates
    - Queue depths
    - Processing times

### 3. Backup and Recovery
1. Database Backups
    - Regular automated backups
    - Point-in-time recovery capability
    - Backup testing procedures
2. Configuration Management
    - Version control for configurations
    - Documentation of deployment procedures
