## Overview

<Info>Available in version 0.10.3 and later.</Info>

The **queue monitoring port** allows you to expose internal queue metrics and monitoring endpoints for your Blnk server. This is useful for operational dashboards, health checks, and integration with monitoring tools (such as Prometheus, Grafana, or custom dashboards).

### Example configuration

```json blnk.json
{
  "queue": {
    "monitoring_port": "5004"
  }
}
```

    * **Environment variable:** `BLNK_QUEUE_MONITORING_PORT`
    * **Dashboard URL:** Visit `http://localhost:5004/monitoring` in your browser to access the real-time monitoring dashboard.

## Web Dashboard
