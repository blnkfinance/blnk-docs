## Overview

```json
{
  "event": "name_of_event",
  "data": {
    "field": "value"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description | Type
| :--- | :--- | :---
| `event` | Indicates the type of event, e.g., `transaction.applied`. | String |
| `data` | Contains the request payload, detailing the relevant information. | Object |

## Handling error notifications

Blnk provides multiple ways to handle error notifications:

1. **System error webhooks**: System errors (e.g., duplicate reference, queue failures, etc.) are automatically sent as webhooks to your configured webhook URL. These help you monitor and troubleshoot system issues in real-time.

2. **Slack notifications**: You can also send error notifications to Slack via a specified webhook provided by your Slack workspace. This is useful for team alerts and monitoring.

To learn how to get your Slack webhook URL, go to: [Slack API: Sending messages using incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

## Configuring notifications in Blnk

To set up how you receive notifications from Blnk, you need to update your `blnk.json` configuration file. This file allows you to specify the webhook URLs that Blnk sends notifications to — both for your application and Slack.

<Warning>
    If you do not have a `blnk.json` file, please create a new `json` file — it contains essential settings for running your Blnk server.

    Next, copy & paste [the configuration JSON](configuration) into it.
</Warning>

Update the `notification` object as follows:

- `slack`:
	- `webhook_url`: The webhook URL provided by your Slack workspace.
- `webhook`:
	- `url`: Your application's webhook URL where Blnk sends transaction event notifications to.
	- `headers`: Optional headers that you may need to include in the notification request to authenticate the message. This can include authentication tokens or content type specifications.

Below is an example of a notifications configuration:

```json blnk.json
{
  "notification": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
    "webhook": {
      "url": "http://server:5001/webhooks",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your_auth_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
