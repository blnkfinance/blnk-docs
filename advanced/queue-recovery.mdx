<Info>Available in version 0.13.2 and later.</Info>

Transactions normally move from `QUEUED` to `APPLIED`, `INFLIGHT`, or `REJECTED`. 

In rare occurrences, transactions may get stuck in `QUEUED` for example after a worker crash, Redis issues, or enqueue failures. Queue recovery finds these transactions and re-enqueues them for processing.

## How it works

Blnk now automatically checks for and recovers any transactions stuck in queue due to any number of reasons. 

You can also trigger recovery manually with the [Queue Recovery](/reference/queue-recovery) endpoint. 

```bash wrap
curl --request POST \
  --url 'http://localhost:5001/transactions/recover?threshold=5m' \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>'
```

`threshold` defines how long a transaction must be QUEUED before it is considered stuck. With `threshold=5m`, Blnk recovers only transactions that have been waiting at least 5 minutes; anything newer is left alone. 

<Tip>Minimum value allowed: 2 minutes.</Tip>
