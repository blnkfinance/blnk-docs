## Overview

Ledger architecture is how you set up and design your ledgers to work for your application. It is crucial to ensuring that your ledger is seamless and scalable.

To design your ledger architecture, you need to first have a [money movement map](/ledgers/money-movement-map). A well drawn map gives you insight into how money flows in your organization, while a good ledger architecture helps you implement and track this flow of funds in your application.

**Let's start ✨**

## 1. Designing your ledger architecture.

There is no one way to design your ledger. Blnk offers you flexibility in how you choose to structure your ledgers and balances for your application.

The Blnk Ledger is modeled after the folder-file system of many file managers. Just like file managers, how you arrange your files (balances) in folders (ledgers) is dependent on how you want to group and find those files (balances). 

The most crucial factor to consider in ledger architecture design is what data is important for your application to track. This typically forms how you set up your ledgers. Once you've decided how you want to set up your ledgers, creating your ledger balances in the right ledgers becomes easy and straightforward to do.

## 2. Sample scenario

Consider an organization building a fintech product with three services — savings accounts, cards, and lending. 

They can either track how their services are performing and measure their position across each of them, or they can prioritize learning about their users and seeing each user's position and activity across each service offered.

### Ledger architecture based on services

Each service is represented with a ledger in your Blnk server. When a user signs up on the product, their savings account balance is created in an Accounts Ledger, their cards balance is created in a Cards Ledger, and their loan balance is created in a Lending Ledger.

So their ledger architecture looks like this:

| Ledgers | Ledger balances |
| :--- | :--- |
| General Ledger | |
| Customer Accounts Ledger | user-A-account-balance |
| | user-B-account-balance |
| | user-C-account-balance |
| Customer Cards Ledger | user-A-cards-balance |
| | user-B-cards-balance |
| | user-C-cards-balance |
| Customer Lending Ledger | user-A-loans-balance |
| | user-B-loans-balance |
| | user-C-loans-balance |

This way, it is easy to measure all loans receivable by summing the balances in the Lending Ledger or track your current AUM by summing the balances in the Accounts Ledger.

### Ledger architecture based on users

Each user is represented with a ledger in your Blnk server. In this case, all of the user's accounts across the services is grouped in the user's ledger represented by their respective balances. 

| Ledgers | Ledger balances |
| :--- | :--- |
|General Ledger | |
| User A Ledger | user-A-account-balance |
| | user-A-cards-balance |
| | user-A-loans-balance |
| User B Ledger | user-B-account-balance |
| | user-B-cards-balance |
| | user-B-loans-balance |
| User C Ledger | user-C-account-balance |
| | user-C-cards-balance |
| | user-C-loans-balance |

With this design, the organization can see the user's position in their application. They can compare how much the user has borrowed against how much is in their account, the number of transactions performed by the user, etc.
