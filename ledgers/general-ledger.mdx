<Info>
A general ledger is conventionally defined as the accounting record of a company or organization.
</Info>

The General Ledger is an in-built ledger made to group balances that represent accounts/wallets owned by your organizaton (Chart of Accounts). The balances grouped by the General Ledger are called [internal balances](../balances/internal-balances).

## Why you need a General Ledger

The Blnk Ledger is a tool to not only record the transactions happening between user balances in your system, but also for transactions happening between you (the organization) and your users.

Most financial products earn revenue from processing fees, card creation fees, etc. They also have to remit account or BaaS provider fees, or pay out interest and commissions to their users. It is best practice to have these transaction activities represented in your Ledger.

Since all transactions require a source and destination, these internal balances have to be created and grouped for easy navigation and reference, hence, the General Ledger.
