import RequestTutorial from "/snippets/request-tutorial.mdx"

## Overview

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to building a simple loan management system using Blnk Finance. You’ll learn how to: 

1. Disburse loans to customers. 
2. Calculate and apply interest.
3. Process repayments.
4. Monitor loan status effectively.

For this tutorial, we’ll use the [Blnk TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/introduction) for the implementation. If you prefer, you can also refer to the [API reference](/reference/create-ledger) for details on the available endpoints.

## Designing your map

Before writing code, it's crucial to design a [money movement map](/ledgers/money-movement-map) that outlines how money moves in your system. This serves as the blueprint for your implementation.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  mainWallet([Customer Main Wallet])
  loanWallet([Customer Loan Wallet])
  interest([@InterestRevenue])

  loanWallet -- Step 1: Loan is disbursed \n to customer --> mainWallet
  loanWallet -- Step 2: Interest is charged \n to customer --> interest
  mainWallet -- Step 3: Customer repays \n the loan + interest --> loanWallet
```

This map shows three key aspects our lending fund flow:

* The `Customer Loan Wallet` tracks the amount owed by the customer. All loans disbursed to the customer are debited from their loan wallet. A zero balance indicates that all debt has been fully repaid.

* The `@InterestRevenue` records all interest earned from loan customers.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. A running Blnk Core instance (e.g. at `http://localhost:5001`).
2. An API key for Blnk (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code examples). Required for authenticated requests.
3. Optionally, you can connect your Blnk Core to your [Blnk Cloud](https://cloud.blnkfinance.com) workspace to view your ledger data.

To prepare for the rest of this tutorial, read our [Building a Wallet with Blnk](/tutorials/quick-start/wallet-management) tutorial if you haven’t already.

## Create your ledgers

First, we create 2 ledgers. 

* `Customer Accounts` to organize all customers' main accounts.
* `Loan Accounts` to organize all loan accounts.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
const blnk = await getBlnk();

async function createCustomerLedger() {
  const { Ledgers } = blnk;
  
  const customerLedger = await Ledgers.create({
    name: "Customer Accounts",
    meta_data: {
      description: "Contains all customer main balances"
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Customer Ledger created:", customerLedger.data);
  return customerLedger.data.ledger_id;
}

async function createLoanLedger() {
  const { Ledgers } = blnk;
  
  const loanLedger = await Ledgers.create({
    name: "Loan Accounts",
    meta_data: {
      description: "Contains all customer loan balances"
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Loan Ledger created:", loanLedger.data);
  return loanLedger.data.ledger_id;
}
```
```bash cURL
# Create main wallet ledger (Customer Accounts)
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/ledgers \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Customer Accounts", 
  "meta_data": {
    "description": "Contains all customer main balances"
  }
}'

# Create loan wallet ledger (Loan Accounts)
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/ledgers \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Loan Accounts", 
  "meta_data": {
    "description": "Contains all customer loan balances"
  }
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Create customer balances

First, we create the customer's balance:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function createCustomerMainBalance(customerLedgerId, customerDetails) {
  const blnk = await getBlnk();
  const { LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  const mainBalance = await LedgerBalances.create({
    ledger_id: customerLedgerId,
    currency: "USD",
    meta_data: {
      customer_id: customerDetails.id,
      customer_name: customerDetails.name,
      account_type: "main",
      account_status: "active"
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Customer Main Balance created:", mainBalance.data);
  return mainBalance.data.balance_id;
}
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/balances \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_CUSTOMER_LEDGER_ID",
    "currency": "USD",
    "meta_data": {
        "customer_id": "12345",
        "customer_name": "John Doe",
        "account_type": "main",
        "account_status": "active"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, we create the loan balance:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function createLoanBalance(loanLedgerId, customerDetails, loanDetails) {
  const blnk = await getBlnk();
  const { LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  const loanBalance = await LedgerBalances.create({
    ledger_id: loanLedgerId,
    currency: "USD",
    meta_data: {
      customer_id: customerDetails.id,
      customer_name: customerDetails.name
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Loan Balance created:", loanBalance.data);
  return loanBalance.data.balance_id;
}
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/balances \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "ledger_id": "ldg_LOAN_LEDGER_ID",
    "currency": "USD",
    "meta_data": {
        "customer_id": "12345",
        "customer_name": "John Doe"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Disbursing a loan

When the loan is disbursed, money is deducted from the `Loan Balance` to the `Main Balance`.

```txt Example scenario
* Starting Scenario
Alice Loan Balance: 0.00 USD
Alice Main Balance: 0.00 USD

* Loan Request Scenario:
Alice borrows 500.00 USD

* After Loan Disbursement:
Alice Loan Balance: - 500.00 USD (debt owed)
Alice Main Balance: + 500.00 USD (funds received by customer)
```

Initiate this transaction in your ledger:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function disburseLoan(loanBalanceId, customerBalanceId, loanAmount) {
  const blnk = await getBlnk();
  const { Transactions, LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  // Generate a unique reference for this transaction
  const reference = `LOAN-DISBURSE-${Date.now()}`;
  
  const disbursement = await Transactions.create({
    amount: loanAmount,
    precision: 100,
    reference: reference,
    currency: "USD",
    source: loanBalanceId,
    destination: customerBalanceId,
    description: "Loan disbursement",
    allow_overdraft: true, // This allows the loan balance to go negative
    meta_data: {
      transaction_type: "loan_disbursement",
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Loan disbursed:", disbursement.data);
  
  // Create loan status in metadata
  await LedgerBalances.updateMetadata(loanBalanceId, {
    metadata: {
      loan_status: "active",
      pri
    }
  });
  
  return disbursement.data.transaction_id;
}
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/transactions \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "amount": 500,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "LOAN-DISBURSE-1709741652384",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_LOAN_BALANCE_ID",
    "destination": "bln_CUSTOMER_BALANCE_ID",
    "description": "Loan disbursement",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "meta_data": {
        "transaction_type": "loan_disbursement",
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Calculate and charge daily interest

Next, we need to calculate daily interest based on the formula $P * R * T$, where:

* P is the principal (loan amount or remaining balance)
* R is the daily interest rate
* T is time (1 day for daily interest)

According to our map, interest is transferred from the `Loan Balance` to the `@InterestRevenue`.

```txt Example scenario (cont'd)
* After 1 day, with 1% daily interest
+5 USD added to @InterestRevenue
-5 USD deducted from Loan Balance

* Final Balances
Alice Loan Balance: - 505.00 USD (debt owed, including interest)
Alice Main Balance: 500.00 USD (funds received by customer)
@InterestRevenue: + 5.00 USD (interest earned)
```

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function calculateAndChargeInterest(loanBalanceId, interestRate) {
  const blnk = await getBlnk();
  const { Transactions, LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  // Get current loan balance
  const loanBalance = await LedgerBalances.retrieve(loanBalanceId);
  
  // Get the principal amount (convert negative balance to positive)
  const principal = Math.abs(loanBalance.data.balance);
  
  // Calculate daily interest amount
  const dailyRate = interestRate / 365; // Convert annual rate to daily
  const interestAmount = principal * dailyRate;
  
  // Round to 2 decimal places and convert to cents
  const roundedInterest = Math.round(interestAmount * 100) / 100;
  
  // Generate a unique reference
  const reference = `INTEREST-${Date.now()}`;
  
  // Transfer interest from loan balance to interest revenue balance
  const interestTransaction = await Transactions.create({
    amount: roundedInterest,
    precision: 100,
    reference: reference,
    currency: "USD",
    source: loanBalanceId,
    destination: "@InterestRevenue",
    description: "Daily interest charge",
    allow_overdraft: true, // Allow loan balance to go further negative
    meta_data: {
      transaction_type: "interest_charge",
      interest_rate: interestRate,
      principal_amount: principal / 100, // Convert back to dollars for readability
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Interest charged:", interestTransaction.data);
  
  return interestTransaction.data.transaction_id;
}
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/transactions \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "amount": 5,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "INTEREST-1709741780214",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_LOAN_BALANCE_ID",
    "destination": "@InterestRevenue",
    "description": "Daily interest charge",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "meta_data": {
        "transaction_type": "interest_charge",
        "interest_rate": 0.01,
        "principal_amount": 500,
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Loan repayments

When a customer makes a loan repayment, the money moves from their main balance to the loan balance.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function processLoanRepayment(customerBalanceId, loanBalanceId, repaymentAmount) {
  const blnk = await getBlnk();
  const { Transactions, LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  // Generate a unique reference
  const reference = `LOAN-REPAY-${Date.now()}`;
  
  // Transfer from customer's balance to loan balance
  const repayment = await Transactions.create({
    amount: repaymentAmount,
    precision: 100,
    reference: reference,
    currency: "USD",
    source: customerBalanceId,
    destination: loanBalanceId,
    description: "Loan repayment",
    meta_data: {
      transaction_type: "loan_repayment",
      payment_method: "bank_transfer"
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Loan repayment processed:", repayment.data);
  
  // Check if loan is fully repaid
  const updatedLoanBalance = await LedgerBalances.retrieve(loanBalanceId);
  
  if (updatedLoanBalance.data.balance >= 0) {
    // Loan is fully repaid, update status
    await LedgerBalances.updateMetadata(loanBalanceId, {
      loan_status: "fully_repaid",
      repayment_completed_date: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    console.log("Loan fully repaid!");
  }
  
  return repayment.data.transaction_id;
}
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:5001/transactions \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "amount": 200,
    "precision": 100,
    "reference": "LOAN-REPAY-1709741952867",
    "currency": "USD",
    "source": "bln_CUSTOMER_BALANCE_ID",
    "destination": "bln_LOAN_BALANCE_ID",
    "description": "Loan repayment",
    "meta_data": {
        "transaction_type": "loan_repayment",
        "payment_method": "bank_transfer"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Check loan status

We can check if a loan is fully repaid by verifying if the loan balance is zero or positive:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
async function checkLoanStatus(loanBalanceId) {
  const blnk = await getBlnk();
  const { LedgerBalances } = blnk;
  
  const loanBalance = await LedgerBalances.retrieve(loanBalanceId);
  
  const status = {
    balance_id: loanBalanceId,
    current_balance: loanBalance.data.balance / 100, // Convert cents to dollars
    is_fully_repaid: loanBalance.data.balance >= 0,
    loan_status: loanBalance.data.meta_data.loan_status,
    loan_details: loanBalance.data.meta_data
  };
  
  console.log("Loan status:", status);
  return status;
}
```
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:5001/balances/bln_LOAN_BALANCE_ID \
  --header 'X-blnk-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
</CodeGroup>
