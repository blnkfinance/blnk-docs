## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through implementing multicurrency transactions with the Blnk Ledger.

For this tutorial, we’ll use the [Blnk TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/introduction) for the implementation. If you prefer, you can also refer to the [API reference](/reference/create-ledger) for details on the available endpoints.

## Designing your map

Before writing code, it's crucial to design a [money movement map](/ledgers/money-movement-map) that outlines how money moves in your system. This serves as the blueprint for your implementation.

```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        usdSettle([@USDLiquidity])
        usd([Customer USD Wallet])
        gbp([Customer GBP Wallet])
        gbpSettle([@GBPLiquidity])
        
        subgraph sendUSD [Send USD]
            usd --> usdSettle
        end
        subgraph receiveGBP [Receive GBP]
            gbpSettle --> gbp
        end

        sendUSD -- FX conversion --> receiveGBP

    style sendUSD fill:#000
    style receiveGBP fill:#000
    ```

## Set up your implementation

A simple multicurrency transaction flow (e.g. USD to GBP) needs:

1. Two balances in different currencies. We'll use USD and GBP for this guide.
2. Two transactions: one to debit the source (send USD), and the other the credit the destination balance (receive GBP).
3. Use a linked id to connect both transactions together.

---

## Sending USD

Record a transaction for the USD being sent, and deposit it into a liquidity balance (in USD) managed by your organization.

```javascript TypeScript
async function sendUSD(usdSourceBalance, linkedTransactionId, usdAmount, currentFxRate, uniqueReference, description) {
  const blnk = await getBlnkInstance();
  const { Transactions } = blnk;
  
  const send = await Transactions.create({
    amount: usdAmount,
    precision: 100,
    reference: uniqueReference,
    description: description || "Transfer for GBP",
    currency: "USD",
    source: usdSourceBalance,
    destination: "@USDLiquidity",
    meta_data: {
      fx_transaction_id: linkedTransactionId,
      fx_rate: currentFxRate
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Transaction created:", send.data.transaction_id);
  return send.data.transaction_id;
}
```

---

## Sending GBP

Next, record a transaction for the GBP received in the destination balance, transferred from a liquidity balance (in GBP) that your organization also manages.

```javascript TypeScript
async function sendUSD(usdDestinationBalance, linkedTransactionId, gbpAmount, currentFxRate, uniqueReference, description) {
  const blnk = await getBlnkInstance();
  const { Transactions } = blnk;
  
  const receive = await Transactions.create({
    amount: gbpAmount,
    precision: 100,
    reference: uniqueReference,
    description: description || "Transfer for GBP",
    currency: "GBP",
    source: "@GBPLiquidity",
    destination: usdDestinationBalance,
    meta_data: {
      fx_transaction_id: linkedTransactionId,
      fx_rate: currentFxRate
    }
  });
  
  console.log("Transaction created:", receive.data.transaction_id);
  return receive.data.transaction_id;
}
```

---

## Handling FX rates

Develop a function to compute the amount the recipient will receive in GBP, using real-time FX rates:

```javascript TypeScript
function calculateGBP(usdAmount, usdToGbpRate) {
  const gbpAmount = usdAmount * usdToGbpRate;

  return Number(gbpAmount.toFixed(2));
}
```

---

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a clear and detailed understanding of money movement between different currencies, ensuring no risk of missing cents.

Other things you can do is:

1. Atomically process both transactions as a [bulk transaction](/transactions/bulk-transactions) ensuring that they either both succeed or both fail. 

2. Use [multiple destinations](/transactions/multiple-destinations) to record and charge spread fees and charges typically associated with FX conversions.
