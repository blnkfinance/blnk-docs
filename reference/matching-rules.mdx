### Authorization
Basic authentication header of the form — `Basic <encoded-value>`, where `<encoded-value>` is the base64-encoded string of your `username:password`.

### Body
<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  Name of the matching rule.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="description" type="string">
  A brief description of what the matching rule does.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="criteria" type="array" required>
  An array of criteria that defines the rule. Each criteria is defined by 3 attributes — `field`, `operator`, `allowable_drift`.
  <Expandable>  
    <ParamField body="field" type="string" required>
      Fields to match. It can be `"amount"`, `"currency"`, `"reference"`, `"description"`, or `"date"`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="operator" type="string" required>
      Defines how the selected field should be compared with internal records. Depending on the field, this can be `"equals"` or `"contains"`.

      - `equals`: The field in the external record must exactly match the corresponding field in your Blnk Ledger.
      - `contains`: Parts of the external field’s value must be found in your Blnk Ledger.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="allowable_drift" type="integer" required>
      Helps to accomodate small variations in transaction amounts between both records. Only applicable to amount and date fields. 

      - Amount drift: Measured in percentages, e.g., 1% is `"allowable_drift": 0.01`
      - Date drift: Measured in seconds, e.g., 1 hour is `"allowable_drift": 3600`

      For further details, refer to: [Handling discrepancies with drifts](/reconciliations/matching-rules#handling-discrepancies-with-drifts)
