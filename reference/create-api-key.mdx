## Overview

API keys allow you to enforce access control by granting specific scopes (permissions) to different services or applications, rather than using the master key for all operations.

<Info>
Available on version 0.10.1 or later. Requires master key authentication (the `server.secret_key` from your configuration).

<Key />

### Body
<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the API key or service account. Use descriptive names to identify the purpose of each key.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="owner" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier of the owner or service associated with the API key. This helps track which service or team owns each key.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="scopes" type="array" required>
  A list of permissions granted to the API key. Each scope follows the format `resource:action`. See [Understanding Scopes](/advanced/secure-blnk#understanding-scopes) for available resources and actions.
  
  Examples:
  - `["ledgers:read"]` - Can only view ledgers
  - `["transactions:write", "balances:read"]` - Can create/modify transactions and view balances
  - `["*:*"]` - Full access to all resources and actions
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expires_at" type="string" required>
  The expiration date and time for the API key in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `"2026-03-11T00:00:00Z"`).
</ParamField>

### Response
<ResponseField name="api_key_id" type="string">
  Unique identifier for the created API key.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="key" type="string">
  The actual API key value. Store this securely as it will not be shown again. Use this value in the `X-Blnk-Key` header for authenticated requests.
  <Warning>
    The `api_key` value is only returned once when the key is created. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new API key. Never commit API keys to version control or expose them in client-side code.
  </Warning>
