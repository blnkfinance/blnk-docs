### Amount drifts: Handling minor value differences

Even small rounding errors, processing fees, or currency exchange fluctuations can cause mismatches in transaction amounts. 

Amount drift allows reconciliation to tolerate these differences.

>Here's how it works:

>If an internal transaction is \$100, and the drift is 1% (0.01), the external transaction can be between \$99 and \$101 to still be considered a match.

>| Internal amount | Allowed range (with 1% drift) | External amount | Match? |
>| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
>| $100 | \$99 - \$101 | $100.50 | ✅ Yes | 
>| $100 | \$99 - \$101 | $105.50 | ❌ No | 

### Date drifts: Handling timing differences

Banks and payment processors often record transactions at slightly different times due to processing delays or time zone differences. 

Date drift allows for transactions to be matched even if their timestamps are slightly off.

>Here's how it works:
>
>If an internal transaction is recorded at 2:00 PM, and the drift is 3600 seconds (1 hour), the external transaction can have a timestamp between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM and still match.
>
>| Internal date | Allowed range (with 1h drift) | External date | Match? |
>| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
>| March 10, 2:00 PM | \$99 - \$101 | March 10, 2:30 PM | ✅ Yes | 
>| March 10, 2:00 PM | \$99 - \$101 | March 10, 4:00 PM | ❌ No | 



### How it works

1. **Group related internal transactions:**

    * Internal transactions are grouped with a grouping criteria, e.g., `parent_transaction` or a similar identifier.

2. **Summing transaction amounts:** The total sum of transaction amounts is calculated.

3. **Matching against the external transaction:**

    * The grouped internal transactions are compared to the external transaction using predefined rules:

        * **Date:** The earliest transaction date in the group is used for matching.

        * **Amount:** If the summed amount falls within the allowable drift, the match is confirmed.

        * **Reference/Description:** If at least one internal transaction matches, the group is valid.

        * **Currency:** One mismatched currency invalidates the entire group.
