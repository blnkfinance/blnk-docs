A multi-currency wallet system is a system that manages balances and transactions between 2 or more [asset classes](/balances/asset-classes). In this example, you'll learn how to build a simple ledger that manages transaction workflows between multiple currencies.

We'll learn about:

1. [Defining and creating your ledger structure](#1-ledger-structure)
2. [Balance creation](#2-balance-wallet-creation)
3. [Moving money into wallets](#3-moving-money-into-wallets)
4. [Moving money out of wallets](#4-moving-money-out-of-wallets)
5. [Moving money between multicurrency wallets](#5-moving-money-between-multicurrency-wallets)
6. [Best practices](#best-practices)

## 1. Ledger structure

The entry point of the Blnk ledger system is ledger folders. These folders serve as a way to group and manage assets, accounts, and balances that fit your product or organization's structure.

In this guide, we'll use a simple structure:

- **USD Ledger:** Contains all USD wallets
- **EUR Ledger:** Contains all EUR wallets

<Tip>
    The ledger structure is flexible and can be customized based on your specific needs. For instance, you could group by users instead of currencies, or use a combination of both.
</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Creating a USD Ledger">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript NodeJS {4-15}
        const request = require('request');

        const options = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'http://localhost:5001/ledgers',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE'`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            "name": "Customer USD Ledger",
            "meta_data": {
            "project_name": "SendWorld App"
            }
        })
        };

        request(options, (error, response) => {
        if (error) throw new Error(error);
        console.log(response.body);
        });
        ```

        ```json Response
        {
            "ledger_id": "ldg_5dff0196-11f6-4674-87a2-cf3e39bd20d2",
            "name": "Customer USD Ledger",
            "created_at": "2024-07-05T08:06:26.84333909Z",
            "meta_data": {
                "project_name": "SendWorld App"
            }
        }
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        View your ledgers in your terminal:

        <Card title="" iconType="regular" icon="rectangle-terminal">
        ```bash bash
        blnk ledgers list
        ```
        </Card>

        <Warning>
          Always store the `ledger_id` in your database. You'll need it for future operations related to this ledger.
        </Warning>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Creating a EUR Ledger">
        It is the same process as the USD ledger creation. Only change the `name` of the ledger and adjust the `meta_data` as needed.

        <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript NodeJS {4-15}
        const request = require('request');

        }
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Balance (wallet) creation

Blnk uses the concept of ledger balances to manage accounts/balances in a ledger. In our example, we'll create wallets for a customer named Jerry, who will have both a USD and EUR wallet.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Creating a USD Wallet for Customer A">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript NodeJS {4-13}
        const request = require('request');

        url: 'http://localhost:5001/balances',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            "ledger_id": "ldg_5dff0196-11f6-4674-87a2-cf3e39bd20d2",

            }
        })
        };

        request(options, (error, response) => {
        if (error) throw new Error(error);
        console.log(response.body);
        });

        <Warning>
            The `balance_id` is important. Always store this in your database and associate it with the customer. You'll use this `id` for all future transactions involving this wallet.
        </Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Creating a EUR Wallet for Customer A">
        It is the same process as the USD wallet creation. Only change the ledger_id to the EUR ledger ID and set the currency to "EUR".

## 3. Moving money into wallets

Once ledgers are created and balances/wallets have been set up for your customers, the next step is to start recording transactions.

In this example, we'll cover funding our wallets with actual cash received from the outside world or other apps (banks/wallets etc). This section introduces key concepts in Blnk like:

- [General Ledgers](/ledgers/general-ledger)
- [Overdrafts](/transactions/overdrafts)
- `meta_data`

**See also:**
- [Record a transaction](/home/install)
- [Understanding precision](/transactions/precision)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Funding Customer A's USD Wallet with $200.00">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript NodeJS {4-23}
        const request = require('request');

        const options = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'http://localhost:5001/transactions',
        headers: {
            'X-Blnk-Key': 'blnk-api',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'

            }
        })
        };

        request(options, (error, response) => {
        if (error) throw new Error(error);
        console.log(response.body);
        });

                "sender_name": "Future Design LLC"
            }
        }
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        | Field | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        |`amount` | The actual amount received, in this case 200.00 USD. |
        |`precision` | Blnk uses the concept of precision to accurately manage and store float amounts. For accuracy, always pass a precision to convert the original amount to its lowest denominator (without floats). In this case, to convert USD to cents, we use a precision of 100. So, 200.00 USD * 100 = 20000 cents. |
        |`source` | The source is part of Blnk's implementation of the double-entry accounting principle. In this example, the amount was debited from the outside world (sender) and credited to one of our internal wallets. We use the concept of general ledgers to keep a record of all money coming from the outside world into our ledger. To easily do this without having to create a new ledger folder called general ledger (Blnk does this automatically), you can use the @ prefix followed by what you want to name the general ledger balance. In this case, it's `@World`. You can name it anything, for example, `@external-service-partner` if you are receiving the payment from an external partner and want to track how much you've received or sent to the partner. |
        |`destination` | In this example, the destination is Customer A's USD wallet, which we pass using the `balance_id` obtained when the balance was created: `bln_e39a239a-a6ca-4509-b0d9-29dcc5630f8a.` |
        |`allow_overdraft` | Since we're tracking the general ledger balances (in this case, `@World`), we're essentially moving 200.00 USD from the `@World` balance to Customer A's USD balance. But since in our application the `@World` balance is empty initially, we want to force an overdraft so the transaction goes through. If overdraft is not true, the transaction will be rejected with insufficient funds because the `@World` general ledger balance is empty at the beginning. Setting overdraft to true enables us to debit past the balance. |
        |`meta_data` | This field allows you to store additional information about the transaction. It's crucial for reconciliation and auditing purposes. |

        View your transactions in your terminal:

        <Card title="" iconType="regular" icon="rectangle-terminal">
        ```bash bash
        blnk transactions list
        ```
        </Card>

        <Warning>
            Always use the precision field to avoid floating-point arithmetic issues. For USD and EUR, a precision of 100 (representing cents) is typically used.
        </Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Funding Customer A's EUR Wallet with 3500.50 EUR">
        The process is similar to funding the USD wallet. Here's the key part of the request body.

        ```javascript NodeJS
        body: JSON.stringify({
            "amount": 3500.5,
            "precision": 100,
            "reference": "ref-0-02",
            "description": "invoice A fulfilled",
            "currency": "EUR",
            "source": "@World",
            "destination": "bln_f945f959-bebf-4764-ab2d-2ae194c1b93e",
            "allow_overdraft": true,
            "meta_data": {
                "sender_name": "Nlnk Bank",
                "sender_internal_id": "563825"
            }
        })
        ```
        <Note>
            The principles explained for the USD transaction apply here as well. Always ensure you're using the correct precision and currency for each transaction.
        </Note>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Moving money out of wallets

Once the ledgers are created and balances/wallets have been set up for your customers, and the wallets have been funded, you can record transactions that move money out of the wallets.

        | Field | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        |`amount` | The amount to be transferred, in this case 70.32 USD. |
        |`precision` | As before, we use 100 to represent cents. |
        |`source` | This time, we're transferring from the customer's wallet, so we use the `balance_id` of their USD wallet. |
        |`destination` | We're transferring to the outside world, so we use "@World". |
        |`allow_overdraft` | This is set to false because we don't want to allow the customer's balance to go negative. |

        <Warning>
            Always check the balance after a transaction to ensure it's updated correctly. Here's how you might do that.
        </Warning>

        ```javascript NodeJS {3-8}

## Best practices

1. **Immediate Action**: [Process refunds](/transactions/refunds) as soon as you receive notification of a failed verification to ensure good customer experience.
2. **Detailed Logging**: Always include detailed information in the `meta_data` field. This aids in troubleshooting and auditing.
3. **Balance Verification**: Always verify the balance after processing a refund to ensure the transaction was successful.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your refund process. If a refund fails, you may need to retry or escalate to manual intervention.
5. **Customer Communication**: Implement a system to notify customers about the failed transaction and subsequent refund.
6. **Reconciliation**: Regularly reconcile your internal records with Blnk's transaction and refund logs to ensure accuracy.
7. **Verify Webhook Authenticity**: In a production environment, implement a mechanism to verify that the webhook is genuinely from your payment provider. This often involves checking a signature or secret key.
8. **Idempotency**: Ensure your webhook handler is idempotent. Providers may send the same webhook multiple times, so your system should handle duplicate notifications gracefully.
9. **Asynchronous Processing**: For high-volume systems, consider processing webhooks asynchronously. You can acknowledge receipt immediately and process the webhook contents in a background job.
10. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for your webhook endpoint. This can help you quickly identify and respond to any issues in the payment verification and refund process.
