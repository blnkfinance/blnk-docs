## 1. Preparing your data

External data sources have different formats for exporting your data. To prepare your data for reconciliation in Blnk:

1. Download and extract your data from your partners (payment processor, bank, etc.)
2. Transform the extracted data to the following structure:

    | Field | Type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `amount` | Float | The transaction amount, e.g. 100.50 |
    | `currency` | String | ISO 4217 currency code, e.g. "USD" |
    | `source` | String | Origin of the transaction data, e.g. "Stripe" |
    | `description` | String | Transaction details or narration, e.g., "Monthly subscription" |
    | `reference` | String | Unique identifier of the transaction, e.g., "ref_128GA6Ag1298ahkj" |
    | `date` | ISO 8601 | Transaction date and time, e.g., "2023-04-15T14:30:00Z" |

3. Export and upload your data in CSV or JSON to Blnk using the endpoint below.

### Things to note

Take note of the following when uploading external data to prevent errors or mismatches in your reconciliation:

- Use consistent formatting across all fields. 
- Ensure that each transaction has a unique `reference` value.
- Convert your `date` value to the UTC timezone to avoid timezone discrepancies.
