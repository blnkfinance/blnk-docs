## Fraud detection & risk assessment

* **Type:** `PRE_TRANSACTION`

* **Scenario:**
    * Before approving a transaction, a pre-transaction hook triggers an external fraud detection system.
    * The fraud detection system analyzes transaction patterns and generates a risk score.
    * If the risk score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the transaction is either flagged for manual review or automatically rejected.

* **Benefit:** This process minimizes fraudulent transactions while ensuring legitimate transactions are unaffected.

## Customer due diligence & KYC checks

* **Type:** `PRE_TRANSACTION`

* **Scenario:**
    * When a high-value transaction is initiated, a pre-transaction hook activates an external identity verification system.
    * The system provides verification details, such as KYC compliance status and risk category.
    * If the user is not verified, the transaction is halted, and a manual review is initiated.

* **Benefit:** This ensures regulatory compliance and prevents fraudulent transactions.

## Dynamic transaction enrichment

* **Type:** `PRE_TRANSACTION`

* **Scenario:**
    * A pre-transaction hook retrieves additional metadata for a transaction before it is processed.
    * For example, it enhances payment transactions with geolocation data or customer segmentation tags.
    * This can be achieved by calling a metadata enrichment endpoint, such as:

        ```
        curl -X POST YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/<id>/metadata \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "meta_data": {
            "last_name": "Brooks",
            "verification_status": "Pending"
          }
        }'
        ```

* **Benefit:** Enhances transaction data without altering the core system logic.

## Loyalty points & rewards processing

* **Type:** `POST_TRANSACTION`

* **Scenario:**
    * After a successful transaction, a post-transaction hook triggers a loyalty system to award reward points.
    * The system updates the user’s loyalty points based on the transaction value.
    * If the user reaches a milestone, an automated reward is triggered.

* **Benefit:** Ensures financial accuracy and prevents mismatches.

---

## Real-time reconciliation & settlement

* **Type:** `POST_TRANSACTION`

* **Scenario:**
    * A post-transaction hook sends transaction details to an external reconciliation service.
    * The system cross-checks balances, payments, and pending transactions.
    * Any discrepancies trigger alerts for manual intervention.

* **Benefit:** Ensures financial accuracy and prevents mismatches.
