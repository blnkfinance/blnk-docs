<Warning>
**Deprecated Feature**: The Accounts API has been deprecated in favor of using Balances. We recommend using the [Balances API](/balances/introduction) for all new implementations.
</Warning>

Accounts in Blnk represent bank accounts linked to identities, ledgers, and balances. They provide a way to organize and manage financial relationships between entities in your system.

## Key Concepts

### Account Structure
An account in Blnk consists of:

| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| **Account ID** | Unique identifier for the account |
| **Name** | Human-readable account name (auto-generated from identity if not provided) |
| **Number** | Bank account number |
| **Bank Name** | Name of the financial institution |
| **Currency** | The account's currency (inherited from balance or specified directly) |
| **Balance** | Linked balance that tracks the account's financial state |
| **Identity** | The individual or organization that owns the account |
| **Ledger** | The ledger the account belongs to |
| **Metadata** | Custom data for additional account information |

### Account Creation
When creating an account in Blnk, you must provide:

- **`balance_id`**: The ID of an existing balance to link to this account
- **`identity_id`**: The ID of the identity (individual or organization) that owns the account

The account will inherit the currency, ledger, and other balance properties from the linked balance.

### Link multiple accounts to one balance 

You can create multiple accounts using the same `balance_id` and `identity_id`. This allows a single identity to have multiple bank accounts linked to the same balance.

### External Account Generation
Blnk can integrate with external HTTP services to automatically generate account numbers and bank names, streamlining the account creation process.
