</Update>

<Update label="Aug 27, 2025" description="v0.11.0">
  <Info>
    This release includes breaking changes related to Typesense/Search functionality. Please review the [migration guide](/changelog/v11-migration) before upgrading.
  </Info>

  ## Search with metadata

  We have improved searching transactions, balances, and identities with metadata. 
  
  Use your own tags, customer IDs, categories, or nested fields to filter and retrieve exactly what you need, making it easier to organize data around your business context.

  ## Fixes & improvements

  1. Insufficient balance checks now include inflight transactions, giving a more accurate view of available funds and helping prevent unintentional overdrafts.
  2. Improved handling of inflight transactions during commit and void operations in high-concurrency environments.
  3. The system now properly excludes rejected inflight transactions from commit operations to prevent errors.
  4. Enhanced search performance and memory usage optimizations.
  5. Updated Typesense client library with security patches and improved API compatibility.
  6. General bug fixes and performance improvements.
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 31, 2025" description="v0.10.8">
  ## Fixes & improvements

  1. **Enhanced PII tokenization**: Strengthened PII tokenization functionality to properly handle international characters, emojis, and special symbols without corruption during tokenization and detokenization processes.
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 24, 2025" description="v0.10.7">
  ## Fixes & improvements

  1. **Fixed telemetry configuration bug**: Resolved issue where `BLNK_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false` would still default to enabled. Telemetry and observability concerns are now properly separated with independent feature flags.

  2. **Enhanced transaction concurrency**: Introduced robust locking mechanism for inflight transactions to prevent race conditions during commit and void operations, ensuring data consistency in high-concurrency scenarios.

  3. **Improved transaction reference management**: Updated transaction references to use UUID suffixes for unique identification instead of simple "-commit" suffixes, providing better transaction traceability and preventing reference collisions.

  4. **Enhanced error handling**: Improved error handling for "reference already used" errors to provide better transaction flow management.

  5. **Added TypeSense DNS validation**: Enhanced indexing reliability by ensuring TypeSense operations only occur when properly configured, preventing potential indexing failures.

  6. **Added connection pooling support**: Improved database performance and reliability through enhanced connection management.
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 8, 2025" description="v0.10.6">
  ## Redis TLS verification control

  The Redis configuration now supports a `skip_tls_verify` option. This allows you to connect to Redis instances with self-signed or untrusted certificates by skipping TLS certificate verification.

  **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "redis": {
      "dns": "rediss://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>",
      "skip_tls_verify": false
    }
  }
  ```

  [See configuration docs →](/advanced/configuration#redis-configuration)
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 4, 2025" description="v0.10.5">
  ## Bulk transaction queue processing

  Bulk transactions now use the queue system by default for improved performance and reliability. Learn more: [Why we use queueing](/guides/concurrency#queuing-transactions).

  1. Bulk transactions default to `skip_queue: false`.
  2. Users can add `"skip_queue": true` to bypass the queue for immediate processing.

  ## Other improvements

  1. Enhanced balance creation to prevent duplicate entries with the same indicator and currency.

</Update>

<Update label="Jun 25, 2025" description="v0.10.4">
  ## Fixes & improvements

  1. **Security**: Added authentication bypass for `/health` endpoint to enable health checks without authentication.
</Update>

<Update label="Jun 21, 2025" description="v0.10.3">
  ## New features
  
  This release brings significant improvements to transaction processing, balance management, and system reliability with enhanced locking mechanisms and better webhook handling.

  1. **GetBalanceByIndicator functionality**  
      You can now retrieve balances using custom indicators, providing more flexible balance querying capabilities for your applications.

  2. **Zero-amount transaction handling**  
      The system now properly handles zero-amount transactions, ensuring consistent behavior across all transaction types and edge cases.

  3. **Update balance identity endpoint**  
      Added new endpoint to update the identity associated with a balance, allowing for better customer data management and account linking.

  4. **Kubernetes deployment support**  
      Added comprehensive Kubernetes manifests for streamlined deployment and management in containerized environments.

  1. General bug fixes and improvements.
</Update>
<Update label="Mar 22, 2025" description="v0.10.1">
  ## Granular access controls

  You can now create API keys with specific permissions to enforce granular access control in your ledger. 

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Balance Management",
    "owner": "balance_management",
    "scopes": ["balances:write", "search:write"],
    "expires_at": "2026-03-11T00:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

  [Set your API keys →](/advanced/secure-blnk#authentication-methods)

  ## Overdraft limits

  Set a maximum overdraft threshold using the `overdraft_limit` parameter when you enable overdrafts for a transaction: 

  ```json {10}
  {
    "amount": 400.23,
    "precision": 100,
    "currency": "USD",
    "reference": "ref_abc123",
    "source": "bln_546df224-d7a8-4a20-8e27-399938cb3ead",
    "destination": "bln_8de42141-059f-42ea-9340-00394285620a",
    "description": "Wallet funding",
    "allow_overdraft": true,
    "overdraft_limit": 500
  }
  ```
  
  For example, setting `overdraft_limit` to 500.00 ensures the balance does not drop below -$500.00, providing a safeguard against excessive overdrafts.

  [Set Overdraft Limits →](/transactions/overdrafts#setting-overdraft-limits)

  ## Use historical balances without balance snapshots

  You now have the option to bypass balance snapshots when utilizing the [historical balances](/balances/historical-balances#bypassing-balance-snapshots) feature, allowing your balances to be reconstructed with their transactions only.

  To do this, include the query parameter `from_source=true` in your request URL:

  ```
  GET https://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances/{balance_id}/at?timestamp={timestamp}&from_source=true
  ```

  ## Apply precision with `precise_amount`

  Accurately record amounts exceeding 15 digits with full precision using the `precise_amount` field:

  1. Convert the amount to its smallest unit.
  2. Enter this value directly into the `precise_amount` field of your request.
  3. Include the corresponding `precision` value.

  ```json Example {2}
  {
    "precise_amount": 189207535698279000,
    "precision": 1000000000000000000,
    "currency": "ETH",
    ...
  }
  ```

  [Applying precision with `precise_amount` →](/transactions/precision#option-2-using-the-precise-amount-field)

  ## Balance reconstruction

  Correct ledger discrepancies by recalculating your balance directly from transactions. To use this feature, [update your balance metadata](/metadata/update-metadata) with the following key:

  ```json
  {
    "meta_data": {
      "BLNK_RUN_RECONCILIATION": "SOURCE"
    }
  }
  ```

  See [How Balance Reconstruction Works](/advanced/balance-reconstruction) for more details.

  ## Instant reconciliation

  You can now instantly match transactions and mark them as reconciled, with reconciliation details stored in the transaction's metadata for easy tracking.

  See [Instant Reconciliation](/reconciliations/overview#option-2-instant-reconciliation) for more details.

  ## Other improvements
  
  1. Added database protections to prevent unauthorized changes to transactions and balance snapshots.
  2. Introduced a transaction journal featuring a comprehensive audit log to track all activities within the transactions table.
  3. Enabled metadata updates for multiple transactions using the `parent_transaction` ID,
  4. Upgraded Redis connectivity with TLS support.
  5. General bug fixes and performance improvements

  ## Bulk transactions

  The Bulk Transaction API enables you to process multiple transactions within a single request. It offers two processing options: atomic processing, where all transactions either succeed or fail as a unit, and independent processing, where each transaction is handled separately.

  Additionally, the API supports asynchronous processing to efficiently manage large batches of transactions.

  [Bulk Transactions →](/transactions/bulk-transactions)
  
  ## Backdated transactions

  Introducing the `effective_date` feature for recording transactions with a financial date different from their system entry date.

  This capability ensures seamless [migration](/guides/migration), accurate financial reporting, [reconciliation](/reconciliations/overview), and [historical balance](/balances/historical-balances) calculations.

  [Backdated Transactions →](/transactions/backdated-transactions)
</Update>
<Update label="Feb 26, 2025" description="v0.8.8">
  ## PII tokenization
  
  We've introduced a PII tokenization feature allowing you to replace sensitive customer data with non-sensitive tokens while maintaining the ability to use the data for business operations. 

  This enhances security, reduces compliance scope, and maintains full functionality within your applications.

  [PII Tokenization →](/identities/pii-tokenization)

  ## Balance snapshots & historical balances

  Introduced the Balance Snapshots feature, enabling users to retrieve historical balance data at any specific point in time. This enhances accurate financial reporting and analysis while maintaining efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms for optimal performance and scalability.

  [Balance Snapshots →](/balances/balance-snapshots)

  [Historical Balances →](/balances/historical-balances)
</Update>
<Update label="Feb 22, 2025" description="v0.8.3">
  ## New configuration for handling insufficient funds

  Added configuration parameters to control how the ledger processes transactions when funds are insufficient.

  1. `insufficient_fund_retries`: Determines whether the ledger should automatically retry transactions that fail due to insufficient funds.

  2. `max_retry_attempts`: Specifies the maximum number of retry attempts before the transaction is rejected.

  ## Added queued balances

  [Queued balances](/balances/introduction#queued-balances) help estimate the available or expected balance of a ledger. Unlike [inflight balances](/transactions/inflight), which require certain conditions to be met (commit or void) before being applied, queued balances simply represent the total amount of transactions waiting in the queue, regardless of conditions.

  To view the queued balances of a ledger balance, call the [Get Balance](/reference/get-balance) endpoint:

  ```
  GET http://YOUR_BLNK_INSTANCE_URL/balances/{balance_id}?with_queued=true
  ```
  ```json Response {9-10}
  {
      "balance": 0,
      "version": 0,
      "inflight_balance": 0,
      "credit_balance": 0,
      "inflight_credit_balance": 0,
      "debit_balance": 0,
      "inflight_debit_balance": 0,
      "queued_credit_balance": 0,
      "queued_debit_balance": 0,
      "precision": 0,
      "ledger_id": "ldg_073f7ffe-9dfd-42ce-aa50-d1dca1788adc",
      "identity_id": "",
      "balance_id": "bln_e39a239a-a6ca-4509-b0d9-29dcc5630f8a",
      "indicator": "",
      "currency": "USD",
      "created_at": "2024-07-05T08:13:18.882616461Z",
      "meta_data": {
          "customer_internal_id": "1234",
          "customer_name": "Jerry"
      }
  }
  ```
</Update>
<Update label="Feb 7, 2025" description="v0.8.2">
  ## Direct transaction processing (skip queue)

  Added `skip_queue` option to allow transactions to bypass the queue system and process immediately. When enabled:

  1. Transactions act directly on balances without entering the queued state
  2. System maintains data consistency through Redis distributed locks
  3. Optimistic locking at database level ensures transaction integrity

  To implement, add `"skip_queue": true` to your transaction request body when posting a transaction to your ledger.

  ```json {4}
  {
    ...
    "inflight": true,
    "skip_queue": true
  }
  ```
</Update>
<Update label="Jan 18, 2025" description="v0.8.1">
  ## Updates to transactions
  
  The `QUEUED` state is now stored in your Ledger to enhance organisation and traceability in your financial data.
  
  When a queued transaction is processed, we maintain a clear link to its origin:
  
  1. Each queued transaction maintains two connections to its parent:
      1. Direct link via `parent_transaction` field
      2. Modified reference with `_q` suffix
  
  This ensures:

  1. Clear audit trail of transaction flow
  2. Easy tracking of transaction history
  3. Prevention of reference collisions
  4. Ability to trace complete transaction lifecycle

  ## Metadata update
  
  The metadata update feature allows you to attach and modify additional information to different financial items (ledger, balance, transaction or identities) without altering their core attributes. This provides flexibility for storing custom data, tags, or references.

  ## Bug fixes & improvements
  
  1. Enhanced distribution calculations with rounding support
  2. Improved transaction processing and metadata handling
  3. Enhanced configuration options for transaction and queue management

  ## Reconciliation

  We're excited to announce Reconciliation, a powerful new module that helps developers seamlessly compare and reconcile external records with your Blnk Ledger. This feature ensures data consistency, simplifies auditing processes, and reduces errors by automatically flagging mismatches.

  To learn more: [Reconciliation overview](/reconciliations/overview).

  ## Parent transactions

  We added `parent_transaction` for transactions with parent ids, e.g., inflight transactions, multiple sources/destinations, scheduled transactions, etc.

  For example, when an inflight transaction is committed, a new transaction is created in your ledger. This new transaction includes the `parent_transaction` field, which references the original inflight transaction.  

  Other related improvements include:
  1. Added pagination support for fetching transactions by `parent_transaction`.

  ## Bug fixes & improvements

  1. Add identity and reconciliation collections to Search.
  2. Added new tools for system monitoring to provide better visibility and faster detection of performance issues.
  3. Added rate-limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain system reliability during high traffic periods.
  4. Resolved issues with backups to Amazon S3.
  5. Improved error handling to deliver clearer feedback and make debugging more efficient.
</Update>

<Update label="Jun 10, 2024" description="v0.6.4">
  ## Bug fixes & improvements
  
  1. Fixed dates not being returned correctly.
  2. Improved Search
  3. `created_at` is now set before queuing transactions.
</Update>

<Update label="Jun 9, 2024" description="v0.6.3">
  ## Bug fixes & improvements

  1. Added `precision` to balance monitor.
  2. Added restart policy to migration.
  3. Directus service and `.env` parameters added in **docker-compose** by [vebera](https://github.com/vebera).
</Update>

<Update label="May 3, 2024" description="v0.6.2">
  ## Rates

  We've introduced Rates, a feature that allows you to record transactions between balances of different currencies. 

  ```json Applying rates {5}
  {
    ...
    "source": "bal_usd",
    "destination": "bal_gbp",
    "rate": 0.92
  }
  ```

  ## Bug fixes & improvements
  1. Added `inflight_expiry_date` for specifying when an inflight transaction should expire and be automatically voided.
  2. Added new balance fields and `operator` field to balance monitors.
  3. You can now only commit up to the total amount of the original inflight transaction. 
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 12, 2024" description="v0.6.1">
  ## Added search

  Search gives you full control and flexibility over how you fetch your transaction data from your Blnk Ledger. You can use Search to retrieve any data — ledgers, ledger balances, and transactions — from your Blnk Ledger.

  ## Transaction precision

  `precision` is now a transaction parameter. Blnk uses `precision` to convert transaction amounts to the lowest unit possible, e.g., converting naira to kobo, to ensure that your balances are correctly computed. 

  <Tip>The lowest unit for an asset class is a value that has no decimal point regardless of what amount is passed.</Tip>

  ## Partial commits for inflight transactions

  You can now commit transactions in `INFLIGHT` in bits, i.e., you can release the amount being held by your system in batches based on the conditions you've set for the transaction or participating balance. 

  ## Bug fixes & improvements
  1. Fixed typos in the payloads for `inflight` and `allow_overdraft`.
  2. General bug and performance improvements.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 8, 2024" description="v0.6.0">
  ## Multiple sources & destinations

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/multiple-sources.png" />
  </Frame>

  You can now process transactions from [multiple sources](/transactions/multiple-sources) to one destination or from one source to [multiple destinations](/transactions/multiple-destinations). Multiple sources/destinations help you link similar transactions into one single request payload and making the process a lot more efficient for you. 

  ## Inflight transactions

  We've introduced Inflight Transactions, a feature that allows you to hold a transaction until specific conditions are met.

  ```json Enable inflight {7}
  {
    "amount": 12992.12,
    "reference": "ref_1234",
    "source": "bln_28edb3e5-c168-4127-a1c4-16274e7a28d3",
    "destination": "@World",
    "description": "Card payment",
    "inflight": true
  }
  ```

  ## Overdrafts

  With the new Overdrafts feature, you can process transactions even if the ledger balance doesn't have sufficient funds. When overdraft is enabled, your balance can go negative, signifying that more money has been spent than received.

  ```json Enable overdraft
  {
    "allow_overdraft": true
  }
  ```

  ## Enhanced concurrency control

  Improved transaction processing to ensure that multiple transactions can be seamlessly processed simultaneously at scale. Learn more: [How Blnk handles concurrency](/resources/concurrency).

  ## Bug fixes & improvements

  1. The `precision` value for a ledger balance is now automatically applied to the amounts of all transactions that the balance is part of. This ensures that your balance is correctly computed and no amount is lost to approximation.
  2. General bug and performance improvement.
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 25, 2024" description="v0.5.0">
