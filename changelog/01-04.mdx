## Welcome to our first release

Blnk is now live and ready for you to try out in your applications.
	
In this version, you have everything you need to set up a basic ledger for your applications. You can create a ledger, create balances, record transactions, schedule those transactions, and initiate a refund for a particular transaction where required.
	
We introduced [Precision](../transactions/precision) — a way to keep your ledger balances consistent and accurate.

You can use the Blnk Ledger to:
	
1. View a high level overview of every transaction activity happening in your financial application.
2. Organize the money movement workflows of your organization's internal account balances.	
3. Guarantee that you can trace and explain any anomaly in your ledger.
